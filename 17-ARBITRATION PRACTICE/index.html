<h4><span id="1-arbitration">1. Arbitration</span></h4><h5><span id="1-definition">(1) Definition</span></h5><blockquote>
<p>International commercial arbitration is a means by which international business disputes can be definitively resolved, pursuant to the parties’ agreement, by independent, non-governmental decision-makers, selected by or for the parties, applying neutral adjudicative procedures that provide the parties an opportunity to be heard. ——G. Born, §1.02 International Commercial Arbitration (3(rd) Edition, 2021)</p>

<h6><span id="1-consensual">① Consensual</span></h6><p>Arbitration is based on party agreement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>UNCITRAL Model Law Art 7(1)  (Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance sec. 19)</strong><br>“Arbitration agreement” is an <u>agreement by the parties</u> to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes […] in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>New York Convention Art II(1)</strong><br>Applies to an “<u>agreement</u> […] under which <u>the parties undertake</u> to submit to arbitration”</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="2-resolves-a-dispute">② Resolves a dispute</span></h6><p>Arbitration is a process to resolve a dispute, not a process for the formation of a contract, etc.</p>
<p>Compare HKIAC model clause for arbitration under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<u>Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim</u>arising out of or relating to this contract, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non- contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="3-non-governmental-decision-maker">③ Non-governmental decision-maker</span></h6><p>Arbitrators are non-governmental decision maker who preside over an arbitration.</p>
<p>They are selected by the parties. In their capacity as arbitrators they do not discharge a function or office of government or the national courts. If parties cannot agree on the arbitrators, they are appointed by arbitral institutions selected by the parties or national courts. However, duties, role and powers of an arbitrator are often regulated by national laws and courts.</p>
<h6><span id="4-final-and-binding">④ Final and Binding</span></h6><p>Arbitration results in a final and binding decision (award) by the decision-maker. This final and binding decision can be enforced against the unsuccessful party and its assets</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Arbitration Ordinance, section 73</strong><br>(1)Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, <u>an award</u> made by an arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is <u>final and binding</u> both on—</p>
<ul>
<li>the parties; and</li>
<li>any person claiming through or under any of the parties.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="5-use-of-adjudicatory-procedures">⑤ Use of Adjudicatory Procedures</span></h6><p>Arbitration is an impartial adjudicatory process which affords each party the opportunity to present its case.  The arbitrator’s decision is not administrative but based on the submissions and evidence presented by the parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Art. 18 of UNCITRAL Model Law (Arbitration Ordinance, sec. 46)</strong><br> (2) The <u>parties must be treated with equality</u>.<br> (3) When conducting arbitral proceedings or exercising any of the powers conferred on an arbitral tribunal by this Ordinance or by the parties to any of those arbitral proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is required—</p>
<ul>
<li><u>to be independent</u>;</li>
<li><u>to act fairly and impartially</u> as between the parties, <u>giving them a reasonable opportunity to present their cases</u> and to deal with the cases of their opponents; and</li>
<li>to use procedures that are appropriate to the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as <u>to provide a fair means for resolving the dispute</u> to which the arbitral proceedings relate.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="3-advantages">(3) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Flexibility: Arbitration is based on party agreement and can be flexible as to procedure, language, presiding arbitrators, etc.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Arbitral awards are not published and hearings are not open to the public.</li>
<li>Impartiality: Wide range of competent arbitrators available with different qualifications (including foreign nationals).</li>
<li>Enforceability: Arbitral awards are generally enforceable worldwide (pursuant to New York Convention – 168 member states).</li>
<li>Availability of Interim Remedies: Since October 2019, parties of certain HK-seated arbitrations can apply for PRC interim relief.</li>
</ul>

<h6><span id="1-compulsory-jurisdiction">① Compulsory Jurisdiction</span></h6><p>Courts exercise the jurisdiction they are given by statute, convention, history or practice. Individuals cannot ‘opt-out’ of the Court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Courts Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Jurisdiction of Court of First Instance<br>(1)The Court of First Instance shall be a superior court of record.<br>(2)The civil jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance shall consist of—<br>(a)original jurisdiction and authority of a like nature and extent as that held and exercised by the Chancery, Family and Queen’s Bench Divisions of the High Court of Justice in England; and<br>(b)any other jurisdiction, whether original or appellate jurisdiction, conferred on it by any law.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="2-legal-disputes">② Legal disputes</span></h6><p>Courts resolve legal disputes (not social disputes or moral &#x2F; ethical disputes).  Courts resolve disputes according to and by applying the law.</p>
<p>Not _ex aequo et bono_meaning “according to the right and good” or “from equity and conscience.”</p>
<h6><span id="3-state-appointed-decision-makers">③ State Appointed Decision Makers</span></h6><p>Governments appoint and pay decision makers (Judges). A decision maker is assigned without input from the Parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Courts Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong><br>4.Constitution of Court of First Instance<br>(1)The Court of First Instance shall consist of—<br>(a)the Chief Judge of the High Court; (Amended 79 of 1995 s. 50)<br>(b)such judges as the Governor may appoint; (Amended 80 of 1994 s. 3)<br>(ba)such recorders as the Governor may appoint; and (Added 80 of 1994 s. 3)<br>(c)such deputy judges as the Chief Justice may appoint. (Added 52 of 1987 s. 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="4-subject-to-further-review">④ Subject to further review</span></h6><p>Courts usually have a system for appeals. Appeals can exist as a matter of discretion or as a matter of right</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Courts Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Appeals in civil matters<br>(1)Subject to subsection (3) and section 14AA, an appeal shall lie as of right to the Court of Appeal from every judgment or order of the Court of First Instance in any civil cause or matter. (Amended 25 of 1998 s. 2; 3 of 2008 s. 24)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="2-advantages">(2) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Enforceability: Parties can use the coercive power of the State to enforce judgments in their favour as a matter of right.</li>
<li>Interim Relief: Courts use their coercive power to order interim relief against Parties and non-Parties.</li>
<li>Public: Judicial proceedings are done in the open and subject to public observation and criticism.</li>
<li>Certainty: The litigation process is understood and applied by qualified experts (judges and lawyers).</li>
<li>Review: Judges who make mistakes can be corrected on appeal.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span id="3-mediation">3. Mediation</span></h4><h5><span id="1-definition">(1) Definition</span></h5><blockquote>
<p> <strong>Mediation Ordinance (Cap 620)</strong><br>4.Meaning of mediation<br>(1) For the purposes of this Ordinance, mediation is a <u>structured process</u> comprising <u>one or more sessions</u> in which one or more impartial individuals, <u>without adjudicating a dispute or any aspect of it</u>, assist the parties to the dispute to do any or all of the following—<br>(a) identify the issues in dispute;<br>(b) explore and generate options;<br>(d) reach an agreement regarding the resolution of the whole, or part, of the dispute.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="2-advantages">(2) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Flexibility: Parties choose their mediator and decide how the mediation is conducted.</li>
<li>Time &#x2F; Cost saving: Mediation is usually shorter and cheaper than litigation or arbitration.</li>
<li>Private: Mediation and any settlement reached are confidential to the Parties.</li>
<li>Relationship: Mediation delivers mutually acceptable outcomes.</li>

<h5><span id="2-advantages">(2) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Time &#x2F; Cost saving: Adjudication is usually much shorter and therefore cheaper than litigation &#x2F; arbitration &amp; the other side may not be able to claim its costs.</li>
<li>Cash Flow: Quick decisions allow parties to get paid now to fund their business.</li>
<li>Mandatory: If imposed by statute, no agreement needed and no ability to contract out.</li>
<li>Early Communication: Avoids stalling behaviour or ignoring entitlements.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Decisions are not published and hearings are not open to the public.</li>
<li>Impartiality: Wide range of competent adjudicators available with different qualifications (including foreign nationals and industry professionals).</li>

<h3><span id="b-strategy-in-cross-border-disputes">B. Strategy in Cross Border Disputes</span></h3><p>Important points to consider to identify the most appropriate dispute resolution mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the available counterparties?</li>
<li>Where are the assets of such counterparties located?</li>
<li>What is the value of the contract &#x2F; dispute?</li>
<li>How &#x2F; where would a potential award &#x2F; judgment have to be enforced?</li>
<li>Availability of interim relief?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time when a dispute arises, the options are usually limited and depend on the relevant dispute resolution &#x2F; arbitration clause in the contract.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to consider these issues before or at the time a contract is entered into between the parties.</p>
<h3><span id="c-case-study">C. Case Study</span></h3><h4><span id="example-1">Example 1</span></h4><ul>
<li><p>Approached by client in investment dispute: Client off-shore Holdco, with HK Listco and main operations in PRC.  Counterparty with similar structure. Parties invested money together through share purchase agreement (SPA) of a target company with goal to ultimately list the target. Client had secured put-option allowing to withdraw investment after passage of time (i.e. in case initial plans do not succeed) – put-option secured by domestic parent entity of counterparty. Listing never happened. Dispute among parties on how to unwind &#x2F; end investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Difficulties</p>
<ul>
<li>Contracting parties under SPA are offshore Holdcos with no direct assets.</li>
<li>Assets with parent company of Holdco in PRC (who provided guarantee).</li>
<li>Arbitration clauses in various agreements not compatible (could not be consolidated).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Commence HKIAC arbitration under a guarantee agreement involving PRC-based parent companies (with onshore assets).</li>
<li>Use interim relief under arrangement to freeze assets in PRC.</li>

<li><p>Difficulties</p>
<ul>
<li>During ongoing arbitration proceedings, no contemporaneous asset searches were conducted.</li>
<li>During ongoing arbitration, counterparty had set up parallel structure in PRC to which important assets had been transferred including key employees.</li>

<p>Discovery is a term usually used in common law countries to identify a process by which, commonly before the hearing &#x2F; trial, evidence can be obtained.</p>
<p>The available tools to obtain evidence through discovery include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests for document production</li>
<li>Interrogatories</li>
<li>Inspection of documents, goods, etc.</li>
<li>Requests for a person to be provided as a witness</li>
</ul>
<p>In civil procedures, parties can apply to the court’s assisting in collecting documents from counter-parties and non-parties. They are ways to collect evidence too, but strictly speaking not the “discovery &#x2F; document production” process in common law proceedings.</p>
<p>In arbitration, discovery of documents is called  <strong>document production</strong> and is not automatic &#x2F; mandatory as in litigation (under common law).</p>
<h2><span id="ii-discovery-in-hong-kong-litigation">II. Discovery in Hong Kong Litigation</span></h2><p>After the close of pleadings, discovery by the parties of the documents “which are or have been in their possession, custody or power relating to matters in question in the action.” <em>(O.24, r.1, RHC Cap. 4A)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Possession, custody, or power: including documents of other parties.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Any document which, it is reasonable to suppose, “contains information which may enable the party (applying for discovery) either to advance his own case or to damage that of his adversary, if it is a document which may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry which may have either of these two consequences” must be disclosed. <em>(Compagnie Financière du Pacifique v. Peruvian Guano Co.</em> <em>(1882) 11 Q.B.D. 55)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discovery by exchanging lists of documents within 14 days after close of pleading. <em>(O.24, r.2)</em></p>
<p>To ensure completeness, the court can: </p>
<ul>
<li>order a party to provide a sworn affirmation verifying its list of documents, i.e. to confirm that the party has disclosed all relevant documents in his possession, custody and control.<em>(O.24, r.3)</em></li>
<li>order discovery of a specific document or class of documents.<em>(O.24. r.7)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Parties need to make the documents available for inspection.<em>(O.24, r.9)</em></p>

<p>Parties can refer to the rules on evidence &#x2F; document disclosure in the arbitration agreement. Tribunals can make procedural orders that incorporate &#x2F; adopt the relevant rules as guidelines for the ongoing arbitration.</p>
<p>Below is an extract from a procedural order in an arbitration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</strong><br>The Parties and the Tribunal may, in all matters pertaining to evidence, be guided but not bound by, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration.<br>The Parties shall identify all relevant documents in their submissions…<br>Either Party may request, and the Tribunal may direct, the other Party or Parties to produce any relevant documentary evidence in its or their respective possession, custody or control.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 47 (3)</strong><br>When conducting arbitral proceedings, an arbitral tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence and may receive any evidence that it considers relevant to the arbitral proceedings, but it must give the weight that it considers appropriate to the evidence adduced in the arbitral proceedings.</p>

<h4><span id="2-competitor-to-iba-rules-prague-rules">2. Competitor to IBA Rules: Prague Rules</span></h4><p>The Prague Rules came into effect on 14 December 2018.  The working group creating the Prague Rules comprises mostly of civil law practitioners and the civil law influence is reflected in the Prague Rules. </p>
<p>The Prague Rules are aimed at increasing efficiency of arbitration by encouraging a more active role for arbitral tribunals in managing proceedings (as with courts in civil law countries). </p>
<p>Document production is discouraged and the Prague Rules require the tribunal to decide at the outset whether document production is necessary.  In case the tribunal allows for production, requests have to pertain to specific document relevant and material to the outcome of the case.</p>

<h2><span id="v-practical-application-in-international-arbitration">V. Practical application in international arbitration</span></h2><h3><span id="a-guidelines-for-legal-representatives-regarding-document-production"><strong>A. Guidelines for Legal Representatives Regarding Document Production</strong></span></h3><p>At the outset of the dispute, inform the client  about the importance of preserving potentially relevant documents (continuing duty).</p>
<p>Also, at the outset, clients should locate &#x2F; search for relevant &#x2F; material documents as soon as possible (at the direction or with the assistance of the legal representative).</p>
<p>At an early stage of the arbitration, consider and agree applicable rules and scope of documents disclosure – whether to exclude or limit the scope of document requests, providing time for document requests and disclosure in the timetable.</p>
<p>During dispute, document requests (or objections to such request) should only be made for a proper purpose (and not for procedural advantage e.g. to create delay).</p>
<p>If production of documents is agreed by the parties or ordered by the tribunal, parties are required to abide by such agreement or orders (and do not unreasonably withhold relevant documents).</p>
<p>During dispute, advise client on issues such as privilege, data privacy, state secrets etc. which may affect document production.</p>
<h3><span id="b-disclosure-and-inspection-of-documents-in-arbitration-proceedings"><strong>B. Disclosure and Inspection of Documents in Arbitration Proceedings</strong></span></h3><p>Each party would normally produce with its submissions, witness statements and expert reports, documents in support of its propositions and facts presented therein.</p>
<p>Additional &#x2F; specific production of documents would then only be required to obtain documents going beyond what was already produced by each party with submissions – i.e. if more documents exist that are relevant &#x2F; material to the issues in the dispute.</p>
<p>As discussed, unless specifically provided for in the parties’ arbitration agreement, the tribunal would usually make orders at the outset of the arbitration how such document requests should be formulated and the process and timing for the same.</p>
<p>Here is an example from a Procedural Order given by a tribunal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Disclosure of documents</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Disclosure or discovery of documents shall be carried out with the IBA Rules serving as a guideline.</li>
<li>Any requests for disclosure of documents shall be in accordance with the procedural timetable and in the form of a Redfern schedule.<br>[…]</li>
<li>No new evidence may be submitted in the agreed hearing bundle unless agreed between the parties or permitted by the Tribunal.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span id="c-reasons-for-objecting-to-document-requests"><strong>C. Reasons for Objecting to Document Requests</strong></span></h3><ul>

<h2><span id="vi-specific-issues">VI. Specific issues</span></h2><h3><span id="a-privilege">A. Privilege</span></h3><p>While authority on privilege is limited in international arbitration, it is universally recognized that privilege protection exists in arbitration.</p>
<p>The IBA Rules protect privilege in the Arts. 9(2)(b) and 9(4). While there are additional types of privilege, the two most relevant types (which are also expressly protected under the IBA Rules) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal advice privilege Art. 9(4)(a).</li>
<li>Without prejudice &#x2F; settlement negotiation privilege Art. 9(4)(b).</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact scope of legal advice privilege is defined by national laws and deciding which law applies is a choice of law issue.</p>
<p>Art. 9(4)(c) IBA Rules specifies that the ‘expectations of the Parties and their advisors at the time the legal impediment or privilege is said to have arisen’ should be taken into consideration. This could potentially disadvantage one party where its home jurisdiction does not have laws protecting privilege equivalent to the rules available under common law - Art. 9(4)(e) IBA Rules provide that arbitral tribunals should respect the fairness and equality of the parties when deciding on privilege.</p>
<h3><span id="b-third-party-production">B. Third Party Production</span></h3><p>Generally, orders of the tribunal can only bind parties to the arbitration, therefore, third party discovery cannot be ordered by the tribunal.</p>
<p>Under Art. 3(9) of the IBA Rules, the tribunal can take the necessary steps for third party production if it determines that the documents would be relevant and material.</p>
<p>The Arbitration Ordinance provides for third party production:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 55(1) [Article 27 of the UNCITRAL Model Law]</strong><br>The arbitral tribunal or a party with the approval of the arbitral tribunal may request from a competent court of this State assistance in taking evidence. The court may execute the request within its competence and according to its rules on taking evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 55(2)</strong><br>The Court may order a person to attend proceedings before an arbitral tribunal to give evidence or to produce documents or other evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span id="vii-sanctions">VII. Sanctions</span></h2><p>Under the Arbitration Ordinance, the following interim measures to preserve evidence are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>the preservation, custody or sale of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>the inspection, photographing, preservation or detention of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>directing samples to be taken from, observations to be made of, or experiments to be conducted on “relevant” property: ss.56(1)(d)(ii), 56(6), 60(1)(b) and 60(2) AO; and</li>
<li>interim injunctions or other interim measures of protection (ss.35 and 45 AO).</li>
</ul>
<p>These powers are vested in the Tribunal. However, for some of these measures there is concurrent power of the courts (ss. 45, 60 (1), (3), (4)) and measures made by the Tribunal can be enforced in court (s.60 AO).</p>
<p>Preservation of evidence also available under PRC HK Interim Measures Arrangement.</p>
<p>Powers of tribunal to issue sanctions for non-compliance with production orders are limited. The tribunal cannot impose coercive sanctions (i.e. monetary fines, contempt).</p>
<p>The tribunal can seek the assistance of the courts to compel production of evidence. Alternatively and more commonly, tribunals will make use of their power to draw adverse inference from a party’s refusal to disclose evidence.</p>
<p>Consider the English courts’ approach in the recent case of Active Media Services Inc v Burmester, Duncker &amp; Joly GmbH &amp; Co Kg and others [2021] EWHC 232 (Comm) – adverse inferences were drawn against the Claimant based on the intentional deletion of emails by the Claimant’s sole witness shortly before trial, and the Claimant’s failure to call other relevant witnesses.</p>

Challenges to Arbitrators</span></h2><h3><span id="a-introduction">A. Introduction</span></h3><p>The focus of arbitration lies in the decision-making process, which is primarily shaped by the arbitrator’s role in guiding various procedural and substantive phases. This class’s discussion explores how decisions are made, the role of arbitrators, the types of awards issued, and other procedural considerations. The objective is to understand how these elements come together to contribute to the arbitration process and build a foundation for effective outcomes.</p>
<h4><span id="1-basic-definition-of-arbitration-amp-role-of-arbitrator">1. Basic Definition of Arbitration &amp; Role of Arbitrator</span></h4><h5><span id="1-basic-definition">(1) Basic Definition</span></h5><blockquote>
<p>International commercial arbitration is a means by which international business disputes can be definitively resolved, pursuant to the parties’ agreement, by <u>independent, non-governmental decision-makers, selected by or for the parties, applying neutral adjudicative procedures that provide the parties an opportunity to be heard</u>.  —— G. Born, §1.02 International Commercial Arbitration (3rd Edition, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Non-governmental decision-maker</li>
<li>Chosen by or for the parties</li>
<li>To render a final and binding decision</li>
<li>Using adjudicatory procedures</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="2-the-role-of-the-arbitrator-procedural-decisions-and-beyond">(2) The Role of the Arbitrator: Procedural Decisions and Beyond</span></h5><p>The arbitrator is central to the arbitration process, not only as the ultimate decision-maker who delivers the <strong>final award</strong>, but also as a guardian of fairness throughout the proceedings. The arbitration process involves multiple intermediate decisions, such as procedural orders and interim applications. Key responsibilities of an arbitrator include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Managing the Arbitration Process: The arbitrator (or tribunal) must oversee the arbitration proceedings and ensure they unfold in a controlled and efficient manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Addressing Jurisdictional Challenges: If there are disputes regarding the tribunal’s jurisdiction, the arbitrator has the responsibility to rule on such challenges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Handling Substantive and Procedural Matters: Throughout the arbitration, arbitrators address substantive issues raised by the parties as well as procedural issues, such as setting timelines and organizing hearings. For instance, in ICC arbitration the “reference for the first case” sets the procedural framework for the entire process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deciding on Interim Applications: Interim measures might include decisions on asset preservation or other temporary orders intended to maintain the status quo while the arbitration progresses. </p>
<p>Interim applications represent a vital category of non-final decisions within arbitration. Common Types of Interim Applications may include asset preservation orders (e.g., freezing shares) or other measures that “hold the ring” while the process unfolds. Such measures are not permanent but are nonetheless binding, often serving as a precursor to the final award. These applications are instrumental in maintaining fairness and preventing irreparable harm before a final ruling is issued.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some decisions might blur the lines between full and interim resolutions, requiring the arbitrator to carefully discern whether an application is strictly temporary or part of a broader decision-making framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="3-decision-making-criteria-and-evidence-evaluation">(3) Decision-Making Criteria and Evidence Evaluation</span></h5><p>When making decisions, arbitrators rely heavily on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence Submitted by the Parties: This could include documentary evidence, witness statements, and other factual submissions provided by the parties.</li>
<li>Legal Principles and Rules: Arbitrators apply the governing law and procedural rules agreed upon by the parties during the arbitration.</li>
<li>Terms of Reference and Procedural Orders: These documents (especially in ICC arbitrations) set the procedural framework and reference points for decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the arbitrator considers contractual provisions, the overall purpose of the contract, any registration details, and applicable legal principles. Special attention is paid to the submissions regarding procedural matters and any defenses raised by the parties.</p>
<p>Arbitrators critically evaluate these materials, balancing both parties’ submissions, to reach a fair and impartial decision. Parties thus play a pivotal role by providing the “ingredients” that enable the tribunal to form its determinations.</p>
<h4><span id="2-procedural-fairness-and-single-party-engagement">2. Procedural Fairness and Single-Party Engagement</span></h4><p>The tribunal’s decision-making process involves balancing the evidence and arguments provided by both sides.</p>
<p>A significant challenge arbitrators encounter arises when one party (typically the respondent) fails to engage with the arbitration process. In these situations, the tribunal only has access to the claimant’s evidence and arguments. This absence complicates the tribunal’s ability to fairly scrutinize the claimant’s submissions because it lacks the respondent’s counterarguments.</p>
<p>In such cases, arbitrators often take a more inquisitive approach, asking probing questions and demanding additional supporting evidence from the present party (typically the claimant). This ensures that the tribunal reaches a reasoned decision, even in the absence of the other party. For example, the tribunal may ask claimants to consider potential defenses a respondent might raise, as well as the weaknesses in their own claims. This proactive scrutiny helps fill information gaps caused by single-party participation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether both parties participate, arbitrators must adhere to fundamental principles of procedural fairness. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing all parties with a reasonable opportunity to present their case.</li>
<li>Setting down procedural frameworks (such as aligned timetables) that offer parity to both sides.</li>
<li>Ensuring decisions comply with the procedural rules and legal framework governing the arbitration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arbitrators must avoid any appearance of bias or unfairness, even in situations where one party fails to participate.</p>
<h4><span id="3-fundamental-duties-of-the-arbitrator">3. Fundamental Duties of the Arbitrator</span></h4><blockquote>
<p><em>AO s. 46, Model Law Art 18</em></p>
<p>Arbitrators owe the following due process duties to the parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>To treat the parties with equality;</li>
<li>To be independent;</li>
<li>To act fairly and impartially, giving them a reasonable opportunity to present their case and to address the case of their opponent;</li>
<li>To use procedures appropriate for the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delays and expenses, and providing fair means for resolving the dispute.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensuring Fair Party Participation</p>
<p>A fundamental principle in arbitration is that parties must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit their evidence and arguments. Even in cases where one party, such as a respondent, may fail to engage—as illustrated by a scenario where the respondent did not address key payment issues—the arbitrator cannot simply disregard the matter. Instead, a fair process requires setting up clear procedures that allow both sides to make submissions. This ensures that non-engagement by one party does not automatically simplify or prejudice the decision-making process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establishing Procedural Timetables</p>
<p>To guarantee fairness, it is common practice to establish uniform time frames for submissions. For example, both parties may be given an identical period—such as four weeks—to present their evidence. Some arbitration tribunals further enhance efficiency by employing a consolidated timetable, where all parties adhere to a single, clearly defined schedule. This method supports orderly governance of the arbitration process and ensures that all decisions are made in accordance with the rules chosen by the parties, strictly following the agreed procedural framework without arbitrary timing adjustments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-independence-v-impartiality">4. Independence v Impartiality</span></h4><p>Hong Kong requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Independence: the existence of a relationship between the arbitrators and one of the parties. Usually capable of objective quantification.<br>  <em>e.g. arbitrator is 30% shareholder in one of the parties</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Impartiality: the arbitrator’s state of mind which is more difficult to assess &#x2F; subjective<br>  <em>e.g. arbitrator actively prefers one party over the other</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every jurisdiction requires both:</p>
<ul>
<li>England requires impartiality only_(s. 24(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act)_</li>
<li>USA requires impartiality only <em>(s10(a)(2) Federal Arbitration Act)</em></li>

<ul>
<li>An arbitrator is under a duty to disclose facts and circumstances which would or might reasonably give rise to the appearance of bias</li>
<li>The legal duty is aligned with the IBA Guidelines on Conflict of Interest in Arbitration</li>
<li>The extent of the duty depends upon the customs and practice of the type of arbitration</li>
<li>The IBA Guidelines “assist the court in identifying what is an unacceptable conflict of interest and what matters may require disclosure”</li>
<li>Failure to disclose might show “a lack of regard to the interests of the non-common party”</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-disclosure cannot by itself make an arbitrator partial or lacking independence; only the facts or circumstances that he or she failed to disclose can do so. (IBA Rules, part II, para. 5).</p>

<ul>
<li>The arbitration can be easily ended if there is no jurisdiction</li>

<li>The dispute falls outside the scope of the arbitration agreement and the tribunal’s jurisdiction</li>

<p> <strong>UNCITRAL Model Law Art 16</strong><br><u>The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction</u>, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.</p>

<h4><span id="2-jurisdiction-vs-admissibility">2. Jurisdiction vs Admissibility</span></h4><p>Example case: <em>T v B [2021] HKCFI 3645</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>On a conceptual level, the distinction between what would normally be considered a  jurisdictional  challenge  and  the  prematurity  issue  is  intuitive. A  typical jurisdictional  challenge  concerns  the  existence,  scope  and  validity  of  an arbitration agreement.  The answer to such a challenge is a binary one; the tribunal either has jurisdiction or has no jurisdiction.  The lack of jurisdiction is permanent, and parties cannot cure the defects by entering into an arbitration clause ex post facto or to rewrite the clause to bring the dispute within its ambit.</li>
<li>In comparison, an allegation that the institution of arbitration is premature does not entail a permanent bar to arbitration.  The bar is a temporary one.  The bar could be removed once the parties have complied with the contractually agreed pre- arbitration requirements.  An attempt to enforce pre-arbitration procedures is a positive affirmation of the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, instead of the denial of the agreement.  This  puts  a  prematurity  objection  at  the  opposite  side  of  a  conventional jurisdictional challenge.</li>

<p>Most national courts have annulled international awards on the basis of public policy only in limited, exceptional circumstances. In most jurisdictions, the public policy doctrine is not a basis for reviewing the substance of the arbitrators’ award in an annulment action, and has generally been invoked only in cases of clear violations of fundamental, mandatory legal rules, not in cases of judicial disagreement with a tribunal’s substantive decisions or procedural rulings.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the “public policy” which may be invoked to resist recognition under Art. V(2) of the NY Convention and Art. 36(1)(b) of the ML is “national” public policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is explicit from the texts which refer to the public policy “of that country&#x2F;State” (i.e. the judicial enforcement forum).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my judgment, the position is as follows. Before a Convention jurisdiction can, in keeping with its being a party to the Convention, refuse enforcement of a Convention award on public policy grounds, the award must be so fundamentally offensive to that jurisdiction’s notions of justice that, despite its being a party to the Convention, it cannot reasonably be expected to overlook the objection. </p>

<p>On public policy, Overseas argues that “various actions by United States officials subsequent to the severance of American-Egyptian relations-most particularly, AID’s withdrawal of financial support for the Overseas-RAKTA contract-required Overseas, as a loyal American citizen, to abandon the project. Enforcement of an award predicated on the feasibility of Overseas’ returning to work in defiance of these expressions of national policy would therefore allegedly contravene United States public policy”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>In equating “national” policy with United States “public” policy, the appellant quite plainly misses the mark.</u>To read the public policy defense as a parochial device protective of national political interests would seriously undermine the Convention’s utility. This provision was not meant to enshrine the vagaries of international politics under the rubric of “public policy.” Rather, a circumscribed public policy doctrine was contemplated by the Convention’s framers and every indication is that the United States, in acceding to the Convention, meant to subscribe to this supranational emphasis. Cf. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., U.S., 42 U.S.L.W. 4911, 4915-16 n. 15 (June 17, 1974).5<br>To deny enforcement of this award largely because of the United States falling out with Egypt in recent years would mean converting a defense intended to be of narrow scope into a major loophole in the Convention’s mechanism for enforcement. We have little hesitation, therefore, in disallowing Overseas proposed public policy defense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, as noted, the United States as amicus curiae supports affirmance of the district court’s confirmation of the ICC’s award. An expression of national policy is not necessarily dispositive of the public policy issue under the Convention. See Parsons Whittemore, 508 F.2d at 974 (“To read the public policy defense as a parochial device protective of national political interests would seriously undermine the Convention’s utility.”). Nonetheless, given Cubic’s invocation of our country’s fraught relationship with Iran as expressed through various trade sanctions, the government’s confirma- tion that the ICC’s award comports with the national and for- eign policy of the United States is entitled to great weight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ: “In regard to the refusal of enforcement of Convention awards on public policy grounds, there are references in the cases and texts to what has been called “international public policy”. Does this mean some standard common to all civilized nations? Or does it mean those elements of a State’s own public policy which are so fundamental to its notions of justice that its courts feel obliged to apply the same not only to purely internal matters but even to matters with a foreign element by which other States are affected? I think that it should be taken to mean the latter. If it were the former, it would become so difficult of ascertainment that a court may well feel obliged as the Supreme Court of India did in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd v. General Electric Co. Yearbook Comm. Arb’n XX (1995) 681 at p.700  to abandon the search for it.<br>“In the present context, I think that a distinction can and should be made between the effect of actual bias and that of apparent bias. [……] Actual bias would be more than our courts could overlook even where the award concerned is a Convention award. But short of actual bias, I do not think that the Hong Kong courts would be justified in refusing enforcement of a Convention award on public policy grounds as soon as appearances fall short of what we insist upon in regard to impartiality where domestic cases or arbitrations are concerned. Our stance must be that something more serious even than that is required for refusing such enforcement. In adopting such a stance, we would be proceeding in conformity with the stance generally adopted in regard to Convention award enforcement by the commercial jurisdictions whose decisions from around the globe have been cited to us by leading counsel for the buyer.”</p>

<h3><span id="c-ila-report-on-public-policy-2002">C. ILA Report on Public Policy (2002)</span></h3><p>Final Report on Public Policy as a Bar to Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards made recommendations in relation to public policy as a ground for refusal to enforce.</p>
<p>Key recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>The finality of awards rendered in the context of international commercial arbitration should be respected save in exceptional circumstances. </li>
<li>Such exceptional circumstances may in particular be found to exist if recognition or enforcement of the international arbitral award would be against international public policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify which rules are forming the public policy of any State, the ILA Recommendations provided three categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental principles</li>
<li>Public Policy Rules</li>
<li>International Obligations</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="1-fundamental-principles">1. Fundamental principles</span></h4><p>Category 1: Fundamental principles pertaining to justice or morality, that the state wishes to protect even when it is not directly concerned.</p>
<p>The court verifying the arbitral award conformity with fundamental principles should do so by reference to those (substantive and procedural) principles considered fundamental in its own legal system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Substantive principles: e.g., prohibition of abuse of rights</li>
<li>Procedural principles: e.g., a requirement that the arbitral tribunal be impartial</li>
</ul>
<p>No waiver</p>
<h4><span id="2-public-policy-rules">2. Public Policy Rules</span></h4><p>Category 2: Public Policy Rules designed to serve the essential political, social or economic interests of the State, these being known as “lois de police” or “public policy rules”.</p>
<p>An example of a public policy rule is competition law (i.e. anti-trust law). </p>
<p>An award contrary to a rule of public policy is to be refused to enforcement if: </p>
<p>“(i) the scope of said rule is intended to encompass the situation under consideration; and </p>
<p>(ii) recognition or enforcement of the award would manifestly disrupt the essential political, social or economic interests protected by the rule.”</p>
<h4><span id="3-international-obligations">3. International Obligations</span></h4><p>Category 3: Obligations – the duty of the State to respect its obligations towards other States or international organisations.</p>
<p>An example of an international obligation is a United Nations resolution imposing sanctions. </p>
<p>Some rules, such as those prohibiting corruption, fall into more than one category.</p>

<ul>
<li>Principles to be drawn from English authorities:<ul>
<li>If the underlying contract is in itself contrary to public policy (e.g. a contract to share the proceeds of crime), the award may be refused enforcement on the grounds of public policy</li>
<li>It is important to distinguish between domestic public policy in English law and considerations of international public policy applied by the English courts so as to disapply foreign law or refuse to enforce an arbitral award, as the case may be.</li>
<li>The mere fact that the performance of the contract may be illegal in the place of performance, without more, will not render an award on the basis of such a contract unenforceable in England, where the contract is legal by its applicable law and by the lex arbitri</li>
<li>If it is apparent on the face of the award that the contract was made with the intention of violating the law of a foreign friendly State, then the enforcement of an award rendered on the basis of such a contract may be contrary to English public policy.</li>
<li>The court has to perform a balancing exercise between the finality that prima facie should exist particularly for those that agree to have their disputes arbitrated, against the policy of ensuring that the enforcement power of the English court is not abused</li>

<p>The claims made by the respondent as to the sham transactions of supply of materials being loans in disguise are credible, and supported by the evidence of Mr Y from HD.

<blockquote>
<p>The important issue of whether the underlying HD Contracts and MD Contracts were illegal and unenforceable under PRC law, so as to render the Guarantee void and unenforceable against the respondent, <u>is not in my view addressed in the Award with adequate reasons, and it would offend our Court’s notions of fairness and justice to enforce the Award when it might be tainted by illegality, and when a significant issue brought before the tribunal for determination has not been seen to be properly considered and determined</u>, contrary to the parties’ legitimate and reasonable expectations.</p>

Respondents complained that the arbitrator had unjustifiably refused to admit a PRC Judgment as evidence in the arbitration, such that the Respondents were deprived of a full opportunity to present their case on a key issue.</li>
<li>Held: Error in (PRC) law is not contrary to Hong Kong public policy, nor is it unjust (Hebei Import &amp; Export Corp v Polytek Engineering Co Ltd (1999) 2 HKCFAR 111).</li>
<li>To justify refusing enforcement, the violation of public policy must be “contrary to the fundamental conceptions of morality and justice” of the forum – i.e. Hong Kong.</li>
<li>The Court held that Hong Kong is not the correct forum to decide whether the award would violate PRC public policy, nor can it review the decision of the arbitrator that the agreement did not require approval under PRC law. To the extent that enforcement of the award is sought in the PRC, the Respondents are free to resist enforcement there.</li>

<p>⚖️ <strong>Shanghai Fusheng Soya-Food Co Ltd v Pulmuone Holdings Co Ltd [2014] HKEC 825</strong></p>
<p>The applicants argued that the arbitral award should be set aside because the arbitral tribunal had failed to take into account an earlier PRC court judgment, which was partially in favour of the applicants. The tribunal had taken the position that no further submissions or evidence (including the judgment) could be produced as it had already declared the arbitral proceedings closed.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the fundamental conceptions of morality and justice of the law of the forum”. </p>
<p>Specifically, for setting aside an arbitral award under Article 34 of the Model Law, the court will only consider the public policy objection in terms of the structural integrity of the arbitration proceedings and not the substantive merits of the dispute or the correctness of the award. </p>
<p>By choosing arbitration, parties should be aware that arbitral awards are binding and final. The public policy’s bias towards enforcement cannot be counterbalanced by the mere fact that there was an error by an arbitrator.</p>
<p>Also noted that under the Model Law, Courts have a residual discretion to enforce awards despite the proven existence of a valid public policy ground.</p>

<p>Dispute arose from agreement for cryptocurrency wealth management. Award rendered for breach of contract for failure to deliver cryptocurrency as agreed by parties, Tribunal awarded damages for breach.</p>
<p>Court found that Bitcoin does not have the same legal status as fiat currency, and cannot and should not be circulated in the market. Chinese law essentially prohibits redemption, trading and circulation of Bitcoin in PRC.</p>
<p>Court held that Tribunal’s order for compensation equated to redemption, which contravenes the spirit of PRC policies and violates the public interest. It therefore set aside the arbitral award.</p>

Introduction</span></h2><h3><span id="a-what-are-interlocutory-proceedings">A. What are Interlocutory Proceedings?</span></h3><p>Interlocutory Proceedings are applications at any stage, prior to trial, of existing (or contemplated) proceedings for an order or ruling of the arbitral panel (or the court) on a particular issue. </p>
<p>Interlocutory Proceedings can be made after the cause of action has been commenced but before its termination (but can also occur at a stage where the underlying substantive proceedings have not yet commenced).</p>
<p>While usually “interim” measures (sometimes, temporary or provisional in nature), certain types of interlocutory orders can effectively determine a case.</p>
<p>In summary, interlocutory proceedings are an important procedural tool in a litigant’s armoury.  When used strategically, they can also create tactical advantages for a litigant.  </p>

<h2><span id="ii-what-are-interim-measures">II. What are Interim Measures?</span></h2><h3><span id="a-interim-measures">A. Interim measures</span></h3><p>Interim measures are applications for remedies or relief targeted at safeguarding the “status quo” i.e. the rights of the parties pending final resolution of the dispute by final award.</p>
<p>Interim Measures are orders aimed at safeguarding a party’s right which is otherwise damaged or affected irreparably due to acts or omissions of the other party before or during the adjudication.</p>
<p>Sometimes called “provisional&#x2F;conservatory measures”, “preliminary measures&#x2F;injunctions” or “emergency&#x2F;interim relief”.</p>
<h3><span id="b-different-types-of-interim-measures">B. Different Types of Interim Measures</span></h3><p>Interim measures can be targeted at:</p>

<li>the sale of any goods as the subject of the proceedings;</li>

</ul>
<h2><span id="iii-injunctions">III. Injunctions</span></h2><h3><span id="a-what-is-an-injunction">A. What is an injunction?</span></h3><p>An order restraining a person from beginning or continuing an action threatening or invading the legal right of another, or compelling a person to carry out a certain act.</p>
<p>Note: When granted by the Tribunal, an injunction only binds the parties to the arbitration agreement but not third parties.</p>
<p>A court can hold a party that fails to follow an injunction in contempt of court. The Tribunal cannot do that.</p>
<p>Types of injunction: mandatory, prohibitory, freezing, quia timet etc.</p>
<h3><span id="b-requirements">B. Requirements</span></h3><p>Preserving the status quo between the parties.</p>
<p>According to s. 36 Arbitration Ordinance – Art. 17A of UNCITRAL Model Law, the party applying for interim measures has to satisfy the Tribunal that:</p>
<p>Harm caused by counterparty:</p>
<ul>
<li>not adequately reparable by an award of damages;</li>
<li>substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasonable possibility that applicant succeeds on merits of claim (however, the Tribunal retains full discretion).</p>
<h3><span id="c-injunctions">C. Injunctions</span></h3><p>Requirements for an interlocutory injunction are set out in the seminal case American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd (1975) AC 396 – three essential conditions must be satisfied:</p>

<li>Damages would be an inadequate remedy;</li>
<li>Balance of convenience lies in favour of grant of injunction.</li>

<ul>
<li>the preservation, custody or sale of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>the inspection, photographing, preservation or detention of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>directing samples to be taken from, observations to be made of, or experiments to be conducted on “relevant” property: ss.56(1)(d)(ii), 56(6), 60(1)(b) and 60(2) AO; and</li>
<li>interim injunctions or other interim measures of protection (ss.35 and 45 AO).</li>
</ul>
<p>These powers are vested in the arbitral tribunal. However, for some of these measures there is concurrent power of the courts (ss. 45, 60(1), (3), (4)).</p>
<p>Where a party’s claim is for the enforcement of rights to property, the Tribunal can make an order under ss.56(1)(d) or 60(1)(a) AO.</p>
<p>To make an order under s.56(1)(d) the “relevant” property must be owned by or be in the possession of a party to the arbitral proceedings and not in the possession or custody of a third party.</p>
<p>If the property is in the custody of a third party, application should be made to the court under s.60(1).</p>
<p>When a court makes an order under s.60(1)(a), it is the Tribunal, party or expert that executes the order (at the court’s “direction”).</p>
<p>An order under ss.56(1)(d) or 60(1)(a) may be made together with an interlocutory injunction ordered under ss.35 or 45 AO.</p>
<h3><span id="b-measures-to-preserve-evidence">B.

<p>These powers of the Tribunal are aimed at preserving property as evidence or facilitating the process of obtaining evidence.</p>
<p>Orders made under s.56(1)(d) may be enforced in court (s.61 AO).</p>

HK&#x2F;PRC Arrangement for Interim Relief in Support of Arbitration</span></h2><p>Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong SAR.</p>
<p>Arrangement allows the courts of each jurisdiction to award interim measures in support of arbitrations seated in the other territory.</p>
<p>Entry into force: 1 October 2019.</p>
<p>Apart from Macau, which has a similar arrangement in place pursuant to the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Macau SAR (effective 25 March 2022), no other jurisdiction has similar arrangements with the Mainland which means Hong Kong has an advantage as arbitration seat due to the extra protection afforded through the Arrangement.</p>
<p>Arrangement applies only to Hong Kong-seated arbitrations administered by certain “institutions or permanent offices”:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (‘HKIAC’);</li>
<li>China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (‘CIETAC’) Hong Kong Arbitration Center (‘HKAC’);</li>
<li>International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce – Asia Office;</li>
<li>The Hong Kong Maritime Arbitration Group;</li>
<li>South China International Arbitration Center (Hong Kong); and</li>
<li>eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parties who wish to benefit from the Arrangement need to clearly and unambiguously identify Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration, and specify that such proceedings are to be administered by one of the recognised institutions.</p>
<p>Note: PRC courts are usually reluctant to order relief extending beyond preservation measures against assets or property.</p>
<p>On 8 October 2019, the Shanghai Maritime Court granted one of these applications, rendering the first of such orders under the Arrangement.</p>

<p>The Arbitration Ordinance does not define arbitration costs (although many institutional arbitration rules do – see, for example, Article 34 of the HKIAC Rules)</p>
<p>Generally, costs are broad and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs of the tribunal (including the charges for administration of the arbitration by any arbitral institution)</li>
<li>Costs of the arbitration (including hiring the hearing rooms, interpreters, transcript preparation, among other things) </li>
<li>Costs of the parties (including the costs of legal representation, expert witnesses, witness and other travel-related expenditure, among other things)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="c-common-costs-orders">C. Common Costs Orders</span></h3><ul>
<li>“Costs in the cause” : Usually at interlocutory stage, indicating the party that loses the overall action will have to cover costs of that stage.</li>
<li>“[Party’s] costs in any event” : Usually at interlocutory stage, indicating that party awarded costs will recover such costs even if other party ends up winning the action.</li>
<li>“Costs Reserved” : Usually at interlocutory stage, indicating that no cost order is made yet and costs will be decided together with the costs for the full action.</li>
<li>“No Order As To Costs” : Each party pays their own legal fees.</li>
<li>“Costs be to [Party]” : Final cost order entitling party awarded costs to recover same from other party.</li>

<li>E.g., English Arbitration Act, 1996 §61(2) Act provides that, absent contrary agreement, “the tribunal shall award costs on the general principle that costs should follow the event except where it appears to the tribunal that in the circumstances this is not appropriate in relation to the whole or part of the costs.”</li>
<li>UK Arbitration Act 2025 allows tribunals to make a cost order even if they or a court have decided the tribunal has no jurisdiction.</li>

<h3><span id="c-united-states">C. United States</span></h3><ul>
<li>Principally in the context of domestic arbitrations, a number of U.S. courts have held that arbitrators lack the power in an US-seated arbitration under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act to award legal fees unless the parties have expressly conferred this authority on the tribunal – the so-called “American Rule” against fee-shifting.</li>
<li>Recently however, a number of U.S. courts have concluded that arbitrators have implied authority to award attorneys’ fees.</li>

<li>Most institutional arbitration rules expressly grant arbitral tribunals the power to award the costs of the arbitration (including legal costs).</li>
<li>Even where applicable institutional rules are silent on costs, the parties’ arbitration agreement should be interpreted to impliedly grant such authority to the tribunal.</li>
<li>2021 ICC Rules Article 38(4) “The final award shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne by the parties.” The “costs of the arbitration” are defined to include “reasonable legal and other costs” (Article 38(1))</li>
<li>2020 LCIA Rules provide for the arbitral tribunal to “decide the proportions in which the parties shall bear” the costs of the arbitration (as fixed by the LCIA Court) (Article 28.2), as well as to “have the power to decide by an order or award that all or part of the legal or other expenses incurred by a party (the “Legal Costs”) be paid by another party.” (Article 28.3) Absent contrary agreement, “costs should reflect the parties’ relative success and failure in the award or arbitration or under different issues, except where it appears to the Arbitral Tribunal that in the circumstances the application of such a general principle would be inappropriate under the Arbitration Agreement or otherwise.” (Article 28.4)</li>
<li>2018 HKIAC Rules provide that the arbitral tribunal may apportion all or part of the costs of the arbitration (Article 34.3).

The Renco Group Inc v The Republic of Peru (UNCT&#x2F;13&#x2F;1)</span></h4><p>Tribunal decided to depart from the presumption that the unsuccessful party bears the costs of the arbitration, and instead ordered each party to bear its own costs and half of the arbitration costs. </p>

<p> <strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Renco claimed damages from Peru after Peru failed to fulfil its promise to clean up contamination in the soil at a smelting and refining complex, which it had sold to Renco in 1997.</p>
<p>Article 10.18(2) of the US-Trade Promotion Agreement (“TPA”) contained a condition that no claim may be submitted to arbitration unless the relevant Notice of Arbitration is accompanied by a written waiver by the claimant of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 of the TPA.</p>
<p> <strong>The Dispute</strong></p>
<p>Renco filed an amended Notice of Arbitration in August 2011, which was accompanied by a written waiver. The final sentence of the waiver stated: “… the Claimant reserves the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits.”</p>
<p>Peru challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction and argued that Renco’s waiver did not conform to the requirements of Article 10.18(2) as it contained a reservation of rights. However, Peru did not raise this objection until March 2014, after Renco had filed its Memorial on Liability, including witness statements and expert reports.</p>
<p>The tribunal dismissed Renco’s claims, in a partial award on jurisdiction on 15 July 2016, on the basis that its waiver did not comply with the requirements of the TPA. The tribunal said that Article 10.18(2) did not permit any reservation of rights, which was exactly what Renco’s waiver was purporting to do. </p>
<p>The Tribunal reserved its decision on the question of costs</p>
<p> <strong>The Parties’ Positions</strong></p>
<p>Peru pointed to Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which establishes a presumption that the costs of an arbitration is to be borne by the unsuccessful party, and argued that Renco should therefore bear its costs. Peru also pointed to the fact that Renco had opposed every attempt Peru made to expeditiously determine the merits of its objection to the waiver.</p>
<p>Renco argued that Peru’s delay in raising its objection to the waiver caused Renco to incur substantial and unnecessary expense of a full merits filing, and that Peru should therefore bear its costs in this regard.</p>
<p> <strong>The Award</strong></p>
<p>The tribunal noted that Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules did establish a presumption that the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party</p>
<p>Renco is to be regarded as the “unsuccessful party”.</p>
<p>Three circumstances which justified a departure from the presumption that the unsuccessful party must pay the costs</p>
<p>In particular, the tribunal stated that it was </p>
<p>“troubled by the manner in which Peru’s waiver objection had arisen in the context of the arbitration” and that it considered that “the proceedings could have been conducted more efficiently if Peru had raised a clear and specific objection to the reservation of rights in Renco’s written waiver at the very outset of the arbitration”.</p>
<p>However, the Tribunal did note that Peru’s waiver objection had not been “tainted by any ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco’s claims”. Therefore, the tribunal considered that Peru should not be required to pay Renco’s costs, and an order that each party pays its own costs (and half of the arbitration costs) was appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The way in which a party conducts an arbitration can be taken into account by an arbitral tribunal, and have significant consequences.</p>
<p>Parties should ensure that arguments that are potentially determinative of the dispute should be raised at the earliest opportunity. Delay in raising such arguments may result in adverse costs decisions.</p>

<p>Case concerning enforcement of an arbitral award. Applicant failed to inform English court that defendant’s challenge of the award in Greece (the seat of the arbitration) might constitute a defence to enforcement in England. While application to enforce award ultimately successful, court held that this “serious” and “material” omission meant it would be unjust for the defendant to pay the claimant’s costs.</p>

Seller (Germany) (Final Award), ICCCase No. ICC-FA-2021-068, 2021</span></h4><p>“In general, both Parties proceeded reasonably and in good faith and had conducted the arbitration in a cost-effective manner. Quite a number of legal and factual issues had to be processed and there is no doubt that a substantial amount of time and effort had to be expended in preparation and presentation of the facts and implications. The Sole Arbitrator is of the opinion that also the costs of both Parties incurred in connection with Claimant’s Submission 3, which was granted to Claimant with the explicit consent of Respondent, are recoverable. The Sole Arbitrator does not share the opinion of Claimant that these costs have been incurred by inadmissible ‘new arguments’ and ‘new evidence’ in Respondent’s Submission 2 and should therefore be borne by Respondent.” </p>
<p>“The only costs on Respondent’s side, which seem not to be reasonable to the Sole Arbitrator, are the costs for the attendance of Ms. Greene to the hearing. While it is reasonable for the managing director of Respondent (Mr. Charles Grey) as representative of Respondent to attend the hearing despite the fact that he was not giving any testimony, it seems to be neither necessary nor reasonable for Respondent to have another employee attending the hearing.”</p>
<p>“On the basis of these considerations and regarding that Claimant was successful only with a very small amount of its claims (approximately 0.5 percent of the amount in dispute), the Sole Arbitrator decides that Claimant shall be liable to reimburse Respondent’s total legal and other costs incurred in this arbitration, as well as costs of arbitration […]”</p>

Airway Communications Int’l Holding Co. (Final Award (Corrected)), HKIAC Case No. 13043, 17 November 2014</span></h4><p>S.74(7) of the Ordinance provides that, in the absence of an agreement by the parties to the contrary, the award may include costs incurred in the preparation of the arbitral proceedings prior to commencement of the arbitration. There is no agreement precluding an award of those costs in this case.</p>
<p>In considering what reasonable sum to award for the Claimants costs, the Tribunal has taken account of a number of factors [specialist arbitration solicitors; years of accounting materials in evidence; large witness statements and voluminous documentation; expert evidence]</p>
<p>The Tribunal has carefully considered the material on the issue of costs submitted by the Claimants. It consists, without any statement of explanation, of billed and estimated costs and disbursements. The Tribunal is not in a position to judge to what extent the estimated figures are accurate although it notes that at least what is described as “estimated” Counsel’s fees are the subject of fee invoices from Mr Manzoni [well known barrister in HK] and Mr Lam. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to make a deduction to cater for the margin of error in any estimate, but otherwise see no basis for reducing the claim which appears to me to be reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>

<p>(3) Whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to order one party to provide security;</p>
<p>(4) Any other relevant circumstances.</p>
<p>Impecuniosity alone is not a ground; concerns of access to justice</p>
<p>Generally accepted that it is in “exceptional” circumstances</p>
<h3><span id="b-third-party-fundings-implication-on-security-for-costs">B. Third party funding’s implication on security for costs</span></h3><p>Applicants have increasingly tried to rely on the use of third party funding by the opposing party to justify security for costs on the basis that (i) the claimant&#x2F;opposing party is likely to be impecunious, and (ii) the third party funder who is not a party to the arbitration has no obligation to satisfy any costs award and will be able to walk away if unsuccessful. </p>
<p>There is currently no consensus as to whether this fact alone is sufficient to order security for costs. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>RSM v Saint Lucia (2014)<br>  Security for costs was ordered in the case. The ‘truly exceptional circumstances’ that justified granting security for costs in this case involved a claimant who had previously started several frivolous proceedings and repeatedly failed to pay the resulting costs awards. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the admitted third party funding further supports the Tribunal’s concern that Claimant will not comply with a costs award rendered against it, since, in the absence of security or guarantees being offered, it is doubtful whether the third party will assume responsibility for honouring such an award.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Hyflux Ltd v Lum Ooi Lin [2023] SGHC 113<br>  Ps were companies in liquidation or under receivership who had obtained litigation funding.  At issue was the form of the security to be given.<br>  Court held plaintiff (i) is not restricted to any fixed form of security, but (ii) has the burden to demonstrate proposed form of security is “adequate”.<br>  Undertaking was irrevocable and unconditional, and, based on public financial information, court satisfied the funder had sufficient assets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vi-indemnity-costs">VI. Indemnity Costs</span></h2><p>Normally, costs awarded on “party and party” &#x2F; standard basis which covers reasonable legal costs incurred.</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, costs can be awarded on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p>Indemnity costs are more generous than party-and-party costs as they would cover all the successful party’s expenses – legal costs, expert fees, etc. and may not strictly be limited by factors such as the complexity of the case as there is no requirement for indemnity costs to be proportionate.</p>
<p>This has the effect of putting the onus on the losing party to show that the costs claimed are unreasonable. </p>
<p>This generally means that the receiving party is likely to obtain an order for a higher percentage of their costs on assessment than would be the case if costs were assessed on a standard basis. </p>
<p> <strong>⚖️</strong> <strong>Dana Shipping and Trading SA v Sino Channel Asia Ltd [2016] HKEC 599</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Dana commenced arbitration in London for Sino’s failure to perform contractual obligations. </p>
<p>The tribunal issued an award in Dana’s favour and granted Dana leave to enforce the award in Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>Sino applied to set aside that enforcement order on grounds that Sino had not had proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator nor of the arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>In its application for enforcement of the award in HK, Dana applied for payment of the award amount as security. </p>
<p>At the same time, Sino applied to the English Courts to set aside the award. </p>
<p>Sino then argued before the court in HK that both Dana’s application for security and its own application to set aside the HK court enforcement order should be adjourned, pending the outcome of the set aside proceedings in London.</p>
<p>HK court applied the test adopted by the English Courts in Soleh Boneh International Ltd v Government of the Republic of Uganda [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 208 :</p>
<p>HK court found that Sino’s case for setting aside was not strong as its argument that it did not have notice of the arbitration was not strong and it had delayed the setting aside application for six months.</p>
<p>HK court found Sino’s tactics to use agents to enter into contracts and delayed engagement in legal actions as potentially concerning as to ability to pay award.</p>
<p>HK Court ordered security for award to be paid and also ordered indemnity costs – normal cost order in unsuccessful setting aside applications.</p>
<p> <strong>Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Sino failed to make payment into court of the security ordered within the period of 21 days.. As a result, Sino’s application to set aside the Enforcement Order was dismissed. </p>
<p>On 13 May 2016, the English court set aside the award on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction and is of no effect (as Sino had not properly been served).</p>
<p>In purported reliance on the English Judgment, Sino applied again to set aside the Enforcement Order and to take steps to stop enforcement taken by Dana, including garnishee proceedings and a statutory demand.</p>
<p>English Court of Appeal later upheld award on the basis that in unusual circumstances of case service of Notice of Arbitration had been sucessful.</p>

National Housing Trust v YP Seaton &amp; Associates Co Ltd ([2015] UKPC 43)</span></h2><h3><span id="a-summary">A. Summary</span></h3><p>The Privy Council found that an arbitrator’s award of compound interest should be set aside and remitted to the arbitrator because the arbitrator had no power under the law of the seat (Jamaica) to award compound interest. </p>
<h3><span id="b-background">B. Background</span></h3><p>The dispute arose out of a joint venture between the National Housing Trust (“Trust”) –– and YP Seaton &amp; Associates Co Ltd (“YPSA”)</p>
<p>Re-construction and development of housing units and related facilities in Jamaica.</p>
<p>The dispute concerned the joint venture’s project accounts, and was settled in part by a compromise agreement (the “Compromise Agreement”). </p>
<p>In April 2004, the parties referred two outstanding items to arbitration before a sole arbitrator to determine: </p>
<p>(i) the interest portion owed to Trust in respect of an 18 January 1999 statement (which had a value of J$27,255,919.92), and </p>
<p>(ii) the contractor’s profit owed to YPSA, which the parties agreed should be 14.8% of the value of the works. </p>
<h3><span id="c-the-arbitration">C. The Arbitration</span></h3><h4><span id="1-the-first-award">1. The First Award</span></h4><p>Arbitrator awarded no interest because he said none had been claimed or pleaded by YPSA.  </p>
<p>Arbitrator ordered that Trust pay YPSA J$24,325,000 as contractor’s profit, 14.8% of the total value of the works (the “First Award”). </p>
<p>Within six months of the First Award, the Trust made the payment of J$24,325,000 to YPSA, as agreed in the Compromise Agreement.</p>
<p>YPSA later applied to the Supreme Court of Jamaica to have the matter remitted to the arbitrator so that he could re-consider the question of interest.  </p>
<p>YPSA’s position was that the arbitrator had been wrong to say that YPSA had not claimed interest because YPSA’s points of claim claimed interest at 12% annually compounded monthly from completion until payment. </p>
<p>On 22 January 2007, the Court remitted the matter to the arbitrator for him “to consider and arbitrate on the issue of interest on the profit awarded.”</p>
<h4><span id="2-the-supplementary-award">2. The Supplementary Award</span></h4><p>The parties made further written and oral submissions to the arbitrator on the issue of interest, if any, owed to YPSA on the profit awarded. </p>
<p>By a supplementary award, the arbitrator awarded J$214,512,232.76 to YPSA as compound interest for the period 30 October 1997 to January 2007 on the profits awarded (the “Supplementary Award”).</p>
<p>In response, the Trust applied to the Supreme Court of Jamaica to have the Supplementary Award set aside and the matter remitted to the arbitrator “to reconsider and arbitrate on the issue of interest in accordance with the laws of Jamaica”.</p>
<p>The Court granted Trust’s applications. It found that the arbitrator had no power to award compound interest in this case.  </p>
<p>Award was therefore set aside.</p>
<h4><span id="3-ypsas-appeal-to-the-court-of-appeal-of-jamaica">3. YPSA’s appeal to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica</span></h4><p>YPSA then appealed to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (the “Court of Appeal”), which allowed the appeal. </p>
<p>The Court of Appeal accepted YPSA’s alternative argument that the arbitrator awarded compound interest not on the basis of any right by contract but rather by relying on a general common law power to award damages.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal concluded that the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to make an award of compound interest was  </p>
<p>“in accordance with the general law applicable to the dispute submitted to him. He was required to utilise his experience and expertise and to exercise his discretion to do what was just and equitable in resolving the dispute between the parties.” </p>
<h4><span id="4-trusts-appeal-to-the-privy-council">4. Trust’s appeal to the Privy Council</span></h4><p>Trust then appealed to the Privy Council.</p>
<p>The Privy Council allowed the appeal, finding that the Supplementary Award should be set aside and remitted to the arbitrator as originally ordered by the lower court.</p>
<p>Privy Council found that the Court of Appeal was wrong to consider the arbitrator’s award of compound interest as being based on a substantive legal right to interest, by way of some contractual right under the loan agreement or a claim in damages for breach of contract or in equity. </p>
<p>The Privy Council further found that the Court of Appeal was wrong in thinking that it was open to the arbitrator in the circumstances of this case to make an award on any such basis.  </p>
<p>The Privy Council found that arbitrators have no general discretion to award compound interest, and should therefore proceed by analogy to the law of the seat’s rules concerning the power to award interest. </p>
<p>Because section 3 of The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1955 of Jamaica limits an award of interest in these circumstances to simple interest, by awarding compound interest in the Supplemental Award the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction and the powers impliedly conferred on him by the parties through the Compromise Agreement and the terms of reference.</p>
<p>Lord Toulson gave a dissenting opinion. </p>
<p>On the issue of compound interest, Lord Toulson focused on the fact that the arbitrator awarded compounded interest because the arbitrator had regarded such interest “as the measure of what YPSA had lost through non-payment of the developers’ profit, because he said in his reasons (to which I have referred in para 77) that not to have awarded the sum which he did (i.e. compound interest) would not have restored YPSA to the same position as if the breach had not occurred.” </p>
<p>Lord Toulson thus agreed with the Court of Appeal that there was no sufficient basis for the court to disturb the award.</p>
<h3><span id="d-takeaway-from-this-case">D. Takeaway from this case</span></h3><p>This case confirms the position that whether a tribunal can award compound interest is first and foremost a matter of the parties’ agreement, and in the absence of such agreement, is then a function of the law of the seat of the arbitration. </p>
<p>For UK, see Section 49 of the English Arbitration Act 1996: in the absence of any agreement by the parties to the contrary, an arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to award simple or compound interest as it considers is appropriate. </p>
<h2><span id="iii-interest-vs-penalty-clause">III. Interest vs. Penalty Clause</span></h2><h3><span id="a-law-ting-pong-secondary-school-v-cheng-wai-wah-2021-hkca-873">A. Law Ting Pong Secondary School v Cheng Wai Wah [2021] HKCA 873</span></h3><p>”In applying the test, the court should first identify the legitimate interest of the innocent party that is being protected by the clause, and then assess whether the clause is out of all proportion to the legitimate interest by considering the circumstances in which the contract was made. Notions of whether the clause has a deterrent purpose or whether it is a genuine pre-estimate of loss would be subsumed by the broader enquiry into the legitimacy of the interest that supports the provision.”</p>
<p>“It is not applicable to contractual provisions which stipulate to pay a certain amount of money by way of a primary obligation. This means a clause can only be a penalty if, as a matter of substance, it operates upon a breach of contract.”</p>
<h3><span id="b-interest-x2f-penalty-clause">B. Interest &#x2F; penalty clause</span></h3><p>Chengdu Zhongtai Transportation Construction Development Co Ltd v Neo China Land Group (Holdings) Ltd [2013] HKCFI 551 </p>
<p>The STA provided for a 15% interest rate in the case of late payment and a fixed sum equivalent to 20% of the outstanding balance if the payment was not made within 120 days after the due date. In the absence of any evidence showing that the liquidated damages and interest provided for in the STA are genuine pre-estimates of Zhongtai’s loss, I am of the view that those are penalties as they are sums fixed in terrorem. The predominant contractual function of the provision was to deter Neo-China Group from breaking the STA and not to compensate Zhongtai for the breach. Hence, if Neo-China is liable, Zhongtai should only be able to claim the sum of RMBY40,000,000, being the shortfall in the shares transfer price, against Neo-China together with normal commercial interest.</p>
