<h4><span id="1-arbitration">1. Arbitration</span></h4><h5><span id="1-definition">(1) Definition</span></h5><blockquote>
<p>International commercial arbitration is a means by which international business disputes can be definitively resolved, pursuant to the parties’ agreement, by independent, non-governmental decision-makers, selected by or for the parties, applying neutral adjudicative procedures that provide the parties an opportunity to be heard. ——G. Born, §1.02 International Commercial Arbitration (3(rd) Edition, 2021)</p>

<h6><span id="1-consensual">① Consensual</span></h6><p>Arbitration is based on party agreement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>UNCITRAL Model Law Art 7(1)  (Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance sec. 19)</strong><br>“Arbitration agreement” is an <u>agreement by the parties</u> to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes […] in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>New York Convention Art II(1)</strong><br>Applies to an “<u>agreement</u> […] under which <u>the parties undertake</u> to submit to arbitration”</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="2-resolves-a-dispute">② Resolves a dispute</span></h6><p>Arbitration is a process to resolve a dispute, not a process for the formation of a contract, etc.</p>
<p>Compare HKIAC model clause for arbitration under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<u>Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim</u>arising out of or relating to this contract, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non- contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="3-non-governmental-decision-maker">③ Non-governmental decision-maker</span></h6><p>Arbitrators are non-governmental decision maker who preside over an arbitration.</p>
<p>They are selected by the parties. In their capacity as arbitrators they do not discharge a function or office of government or the national courts. If parties cannot agree on the arbitrators, they are appointed by arbitral institutions selected by the parties or national courts. However, duties, role and powers of an arbitrator are often regulated by national laws and courts.</p>
<h6><span id="4-final-and-binding">④ Final and Binding</span></h6><p>Arbitration results in a final and binding decision (award) by the decision-maker. This final and binding decision can be enforced against the unsuccessful party and its assets</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Arbitration Ordinance, section 73</strong><br>(1)Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, <u>an award</u> made by an arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is <u>final and binding</u> both on—</p>
<ul>
<li>the parties; and</li>
<li>any person claiming through or under any of the parties.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="5-use-of-adjudicatory-procedures">⑤ Use of Adjudicatory Procedures</span></h6><p>Arbitration is an impartial adjudicatory process which affords each party the opportunity to present its case.  The arbitrator’s decision is not administrative but based on the submissions and evidence presented by the parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Art. 18 of UNCITRAL Model Law (Arbitration Ordinance, sec. 46)</strong><br> (2) The <u>parties must be treated with equality</u>.<br> (3) When conducting arbitral proceedings or exercising any of the powers conferred on an arbitral tribunal by this Ordinance or by the parties to any of those arbitral proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is required—</p>
<ul>
<li><u>to be independent</u>;</li>
<li><u>to act fairly and impartially</u> as between the parties, <u>giving them a reasonable opportunity to present their cases</u> and to deal with the cases of their opponents; and</li>
<li>to use procedures that are appropriate to the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as <u>to provide a fair means for resolving the dispute</u> to which the arbitral proceedings relate.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="3-advantages">(3) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Flexibility: Arbitration is based on party agreement and can be flexible as to procedure, language, presiding arbitrators, etc.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Arbitral awards are not published and hearings are not open to the public.</li>
<li>Impartiality: Wide range of competent arbitrators available with different qualifications (including foreign nationals).</li>
<li>Enforceability: Arbitral awards are generally enforceable worldwide (pursuant to New York Convention – 168 member states).</li>
<li>Availability of Interim Remedies: Since October 2019, parties of certain HK-seated arbitrations can apply for PRC interim relief.</li>

<h6><span id="1-compulsory-jurisdiction">① Compulsory Jurisdiction</span></h6><p>Courts exercise the jurisdiction they are given by statute, convention, history or practice. Individuals cannot ‘opt-out’ of the Court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Courts Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Jurisdiction of Court of First Instance<br>(1)The Court of First Instance shall be a superior court of record.<br>(2)The civil jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance shall consist of—<br>(a)original jurisdiction and authority of a like nature and extent as that held and exercised by the Chancery, Family and Queen’s Bench Divisions of the High Court of Justice in England; and<br>(b)any other jurisdiction, whether original or appellate jurisdiction, conferred on it by any law.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="2-legal-disputes">② Legal disputes</span></h6><p>Courts resolve legal disputes (not social disputes or moral &#x2F; ethical disputes).  Courts resolve disputes according to and by applying the law.</p>
<p>Not _ex aequo et bono_meaning “according to the right and good” or “from equity and conscience.”</p>
<h6><span id="3-state-appointed-decision-makers">③ State Appointed Decision Makers</span></h6><p>Governments appoint and pay decision makers (Judges). A decision maker is assigned without input from the Parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Courts Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong><br>4.Constitution of Court of First Instance<br>(1)The Court of First Instance shall consist of—<br>(a)the Chief Judge of the High Court; (Amended 79 of 1995 s. 50)<br>(b)such judges as the Governor may appoint; (Amended 80 of 1994 s. 3)<br>(ba)such recorders as the Governor may appoint; and (Added 80 of 1994 s. 3)<br>(c)such deputy judges as the Chief Justice may appoint. (Added 52 of 1987 s. 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<h6><span id="4-subject-to-further-review">④ Subject to further review</span></h6><p>Courts usually have a system for appeals. Appeals can exist as a matter of discretion or as a matter of right</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Courts Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Appeals in civil matters<br>(1)Subject to subsection (3) and section 14AA, an appeal shall lie as of right to the Court of Appeal from every judgment or order of the Court of First Instance in any civil cause or matter. (Amended 25 of 1998 s. 2; 3 of 2008 s. 24)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="2-advantages">(2) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Enforceability: Parties can use the coercive power of the State to enforce judgments in their favour as a matter of right.</li>
<li>Interim Relief: Courts use their coercive power to order interim relief against Parties and non-Parties.</li>
<li>Public: Judicial proceedings are done in the open and subject to public observation and criticism.</li>
<li>Certainty: The litigation process is understood and applied by qualified experts (judges and lawyers).</li>
<li>Review: Judges who make mistakes can be corrected on appeal.</li>

<h4><span id="3-mediation">3. Mediation</span></h4><h5><span id="1-definition">(1) Definition</span></h5><blockquote>
<p> <strong>Mediation Ordinance (Cap 620)</strong><br>4.Meaning of mediation<br>(1) For the purposes of this Ordinance, mediation is a <u>structured process</u> comprising <u>one or more sessions</u> in which one or more impartial individuals, <u>without adjudicating a dispute or any aspect of it</u>, assist the parties to the dispute to do any or all of the following—<br>(a) identify the issues in dispute;<br>(b) explore and generate options;<br>(d) reach an agreement regarding the resolution of the whole, or part, of the dispute.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="2-advantages">(2) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Flexibility: Parties choose their mediator and decide how the mediation is conducted.</li>
<li>Time &#x2F; Cost saving: Mediation is usually shorter and cheaper than litigation or arbitration.</li>
<li>Private: Mediation and any settlement reached are confidential to the Parties.</li>
<li>Relationship: Mediation delivers mutually acceptable outcomes.</li>

<h5><span id="2-advantages">(2) Advantages</span></h5><ul>
<li>Time &#x2F; Cost saving: Adjudication is usually much shorter and therefore cheaper than litigation &#x2F; arbitration &amp; the other side may not be able to claim its costs.</li>
<li>Cash Flow: Quick decisions allow parties to get paid now to fund their business.</li>
<li>Mandatory: If imposed by statute, no agreement needed and no ability to contract out.</li>
<li>Early Communication: Avoids stalling behaviour or ignoring entitlements.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Decisions are not published and hearings are not open to the public.</li>
<li>Impartiality: Wide range of competent adjudicators available with different qualifications (including foreign nationals and industry professionals).</li>

<h3><span id="b-strategy-in-cross-border-disputes">B. Strategy in Cross Border Disputes</span></h3><p>Important points to consider to identify the most appropriate dispute resolution mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the available counterparties?</li>
<li>Where are the assets of such counterparties located?</li>
<li>What is the value of the contract &#x2F; dispute?</li>
<li>How &#x2F; where would a potential award &#x2F; judgment have to be enforced?</li>
<li>Availability of interim relief?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time when a dispute arises, the options are usually limited and depend on the relevant dispute resolution &#x2F; arbitration clause in the contract.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to consider these issues before or at the time a contract is entered into between the parties.</p>
<h3><span id="c-case-study">C. Case Study</span></h3><h4><span id="example-1">Example 1</span></h4><ul>
<li><p>Approached by client in investment dispute: Client off-shore Holdco, with HK Listco and main operations in PRC.  Counterparty with similar structure. Parties invested money together through share purchase agreement (SPA) of a target company with goal to ultimately list the target. Client had secured put-option allowing to withdraw investment after passage of time (i.e. in case initial plans do not succeed) – put-option secured by domestic parent entity of counterparty. Listing never happened. Dispute among parties on how to unwind &#x2F; end investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Difficulties</p>
<ul>
<li>Contracting parties under SPA are offshore Holdcos with no direct assets.</li>
<li>Assets with parent company of Holdco in PRC (who provided guarantee).</li>
<li>Arbitration clauses in various agreements not compatible (could not be consolidated).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Commence HKIAC arbitration under a guarantee agreement involving PRC-based parent companies (with onshore assets).</li>

</li>
<li><p>Difficulties</p>
<ul>
<li>During ongoing arbitration proceedings, no contemporaneous asset searches were conducted.</li>
<li>During ongoing arbitration, counterparty had set up parallel structure in PRC to which important assets had been transferred including key employees.</li>

<p>Discovery is a term usually used in common law countries to identify a process by which, commonly before the hearing &#x2F; trial, evidence can be obtained.</p>
<p>The available tools to obtain evidence through discovery include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests for document production</li>
<li>Interrogatories</li>
<li>Inspection of documents, goods, etc.</li>
<li>Requests for a person to be provided as a witness</li>
</ul>
<p>In civil procedures, parties can apply to the court’s assisting in collecting documents from counter-parties and non-parties. They are ways to collect evidence too, but strictly speaking not the “discovery &#x2F; document production” process in common law proceedings.</p>
<p>In arbitration, discovery of documents is called  <strong>document production</strong> and is not automatic &#x2F; mandatory as in litigation (under common law).</p>
<h2><span id="ii-discovery-in-hong-kong-litigation">II. Discovery in Hong Kong Litigation</span></h2><p>After the close of pleadings, discovery by the parties of the documents “which are or have been in their possession, custody or power relating to matters in question in the action.” <em>(O.24, r.1, RHC Cap. 4A)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Possession, custody, or power: including documents of other parties.</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Any document which, it is reasonable to suppose, “contains information which may enable the party (applying for discovery) either to advance his own case or to damage that of his adversary, if it is a document which may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry which may have either of these two consequences” must be disclosed. <em>(Compagnie Financière du Pacifique v. Peruvian Guano Co.</em> <em>(1882) 11 Q.B.D. 55)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discovery by exchanging lists of documents within 14 days after close of pleading. <em>(O.24, r.2)</em></p>
<p>To ensure completeness, the court can: </p>
<ul>
<li>order a party to provide a sworn affirmation verifying its list of documents, i.e. to confirm that the party has disclosed all relevant documents in his possession, custody and control.<em>(O.24, r.3)</em></li>
<li>order discovery of a specific document or class of documents.<em>(O.24. r.7)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Parties need to make the documents available for inspection.<em>(O.24, r.9)</em></p>

<p>Parties can refer to the rules on evidence &#x2F; document disclosure in the arbitration agreement. Tribunals can make procedural orders that incorporate &#x2F; adopt the relevant rules as guidelines for the ongoing arbitration.</p>
<p>Below is an extract from a procedural order in an arbitration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE</strong><br>The Parties and the Tribunal may, in all matters pertaining to evidence, be guided but not bound by, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration.<br>The Parties shall identify all relevant documents in their submissions…<br>Either Party may request, and the Tribunal may direct, the other Party or Parties to produce any relevant documentary evidence in its or their respective possession, custody or control.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 47 (3)</strong><br>When conducting arbitral proceedings, an arbitral tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence and may receive any evidence that it considers relevant to the arbitral proceedings, but it must give the weight that it considers appropriate to the evidence adduced in the arbitral proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 56 (1)</strong><br>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, when conducting arbitral proceedings, an arbitral tribunal may make an order […]<br>(b) directing the discovery of documents or the delivery of interrogatories;<br>(c) directing evidence to be given by affidavit; or<br>(d) in relation to any relevant property</p>

<h4><span id="2-competitor-to-iba-rules-prague-rules">2. Competitor to IBA Rules: Prague Rules</span></h4><p>The Prague Rules came into effect on 14 December 2018.  The working group creating the Prague Rules comprises mostly of civil law practitioners and the civil law influence is reflected in the Prague Rules. </p>
<p>The Prague Rules are aimed at increasing efficiency of arbitration by encouraging a more active role for arbitral tribunals in managing proceedings (as with courts in civil law countries). </p>
<p>Document production is discouraged and the Prague Rules require the tribunal to decide at the outset whether document production is necessary.  In case the tribunal allows for production, requests have to pertain to specific document relevant and material to the outcome of the case.</p>

Practical application in international arbitration</span></h2><h3><span id="a-guidelines-for-legal-representatives-regarding-document-production">A. Guidelines for Legal Representatives Regarding Document Production</span></h3><p>At the outset of the dispute, inform the client  about the importance of preserving potentially relevant documents (continuing duty).</p>
<p>Also, at the outset, clients should locate &#x2F; search for relevant &#x2F; material documents as soon as possible (at the direction or with the assistance of the legal representative).</p>
<p>At an early stage of the arbitration, consider and agree applicable rules and scope of documents disclosure – whether to exclude or limit the scope of document requests, providing time for document requests and disclosure in the timetable.</p>
<p>During dispute, document requests (or objections to such request) should only be made for a proper purpose (and not for procedural advantage e.g. to create delay).</p>
<p>If production of documents is agreed by the parties or ordered by the tribunal, parties are required to abide by such agreement or orders (and do not unreasonably withhold relevant documents).</p>

<p>Additional &#x2F; specific production of documents would then only be required to obtain documents going beyond what was already produced by each party with submissions – i.e. if more documents exist that are relevant &#x2F; material to the issues in the dispute.</p>
<p>As discussed, unless specifically provided for in the parties’ arbitration agreement, the tribunal would usually make orders at the outset of the arbitration how such document requests should be formulated and the process and timing for the same.</p>
<p>Here is an example from a Procedural Order given by a tribunal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Disclosure of documents</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Disclosure or discovery of documents shall be carried out with the IBA Rules serving as a guideline.</li>
<li>Any requests for disclosure of documents shall be in accordance with the procedural timetable and in the form of a Redfern schedule.<br>[…]</li>
<li>No new evidence may be submitted in the agreed hearing bundle unless agreed between the parties or permitted by the Tribunal.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="c-reasons-for-objecting-to-document-requests">C. Reasons for Objecting to Document Requests</span></h3><ul>
<li>Failure to identify document&#x2F;category of document with sufficient detail.</li>
<li>Documents identified lack sufficient relevance or materiality.</li>
<li>Documents cannot be produced due to:</li>
<li>Privilege.</li>
<li>Confidentiality.</li>
<li>State secret &#x2F; data privacy, other legal grounds.</li>
<li>Contractual or other grounds.</li>
<li>Production of documents would be an unreasonable burden.</li>
<li>Loss or destruction.</li>
<li>Considerations of procedural economy, proportionality, fairness or equality.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="d-redfern-schedule">D. Redfern Schedule</span></h3><h4><span id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</span></h4><p>If parties cannot agree document requests, the tribunal will usually ask for the preparation of a joint document with requests from both sides, which allows the tribunal to rule on each request. </p>
<p>An example of such a document is the so-called Redfern Schedule – a schedule for document production popularized by Alan Redfern.</p>

<h2><span id="vi-specific-issues">VI. Specific issues</span></h2><h3><span id="a-privilege">A. Privilege</span></h3><p>While authority on privilege is limited in international arbitration, it is universally recognized that privilege protection exists in arbitration.</p>
<p>The IBA Rules protect privilege in the Arts. 9(2)(b) and 9(4). While there are additional types of privilege, the two most relevant types (which are also expressly protected under the IBA Rules) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal advice privilege Art. 9(4)(a).</li>
<li>Without prejudice &#x2F; settlement negotiation privilege Art. 9(4)(b).</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact scope of legal advice privilege is defined by national laws and deciding which law applies is a choice of law issue.</p>
<p>Art. 9(4)(c) IBA Rules specifies that the ‘expectations of the Parties and their advisors at the time the legal impediment or privilege is said to have arisen’ should be taken into consideration. This could potentially disadvantage one party where its home jurisdiction does not have laws protecting privilege equivalent to the rules available under common law - Art. 9(4)(e) IBA Rules provide that arbitral tribunals should respect the fairness and equality of the parties when deciding on privilege.</p>
<h3><span id="b-third-party-production">B. Third Party Production</span></h3><p>Generally, orders of the tribunal can only bind parties to the arbitration, therefore, third party discovery cannot be ordered by the tribunal.</p>
<p>Under Art. 3(9) of the IBA Rules, the tribunal can take the necessary steps for third party production if it determines that the documents would be relevant and material.</p>
<p>The Arbitration Ordinance provides for third party production:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 55(1) [Article 27 of the UNCITRAL Model Law]</strong><br>The arbitral tribunal or a party with the approval of the arbitral tribunal may request from a competent court of this State assistance in taking evidence. The court may execute the request within its competence and according to its rules on taking evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 55(2)</strong><br>The Court may order a person to attend proceedings before an arbitral tribunal to give evidence or to produce documents or other evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span id="vii-sanctions">VII. Sanctions</span></h2><p>Under the Arbitration Ordinance, the following interim measures to preserve evidence are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>the preservation, custody or sale of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>the inspection, photographing, preservation or detention of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>directing samples to be taken from, observations to be made of, or experiments to be conducted on “relevant” property: ss.56(1)(d)(ii), 56(6), 60(1)(b) and 60(2) AO; and</li>
<li>interim injunctions or other interim measures of protection (ss.35 and 45 AO).</li>
</ul>
<p>These powers are vested in the Tribunal. However, for some of these measures there is concurrent power of the courts (ss. 45, 60 (1), (3), (4)) and measures made by the Tribunal can be enforced in court (s.60 AO).</p>
<p>Preservation of evidence also available under PRC HK Interim Measures Arrangement.</p>
<p>Powers of tribunal to issue sanctions for non-compliance with production orders are limited. The tribunal cannot impose coercive sanctions (i.e. monetary fines, contempt).</p>
<p>The tribunal can seek the assistance of the courts to compel production of evidence. Alternatively and more commonly, tribunals will make use of their power to draw adverse inference from a party’s refusal to disclose evidence.</p>
<p>Consider the English courts’ approach in the recent case of Active Media Services Inc v Burmester, Duncker &amp; Joly GmbH &amp; Co Kg and others [2021] EWHC 232 (Comm) – adverse inferences were drawn against the Claimant based on the intentional deletion of emails by the Claimant’s sole witness shortly before trial, and the Claimant’s failure to call other relevant witnesses.</p>

<li>Section 105 of the Ordinance, any person who appointed an arbitral tribunal or performed any administrative function connected to such proceedings was liable in law only if it was proved that his act or omission was dishonest.

<ul>
<li>An arbitrator is under a duty to disclose facts and circumstances which would or might reasonably give rise to the appearance of bias</li>
<li>The legal duty is aligned with the IBA Guidelines on Conflict of Interest in Arbitration</li>
<li>The extent of the duty depends upon the customs and practice of the type of arbitration</li>
<li>The IBA Guidelines “assist the court in identifying what is an unacceptable conflict of interest and what matters may require disclosure”</li>
<li>Failure to disclose might show “a lack of regard to the interests of the non-common party”</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-disclosure cannot by itself make an arbitrator partial or lacking independence; only the facts or circumstances that he or she failed to disclose can do so. (IBA Rules, part II, para. 5).</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>On a conceptual level, the distinction between what would normally be considered a  jurisdictional  challenge  and  the  prematurity  issue  is  intuitive. A  typical jurisdictional  challenge  concerns  the  existence,  scope  and  validity  of  an arbitration agreement.  The answer to such a challenge is a binary one; the tribunal either has jurisdiction or has no jurisdiction.  The lack of jurisdiction is permanent, and parties cannot cure the defects by entering into an arbitration clause ex post facto or to rewrite the clause to bring the dispute within its ambit.</li>
<li>In comparison, an allegation that the institution of arbitration is premature does not entail a permanent bar to arbitration.  The bar is a temporary one.  The bar could be removed once the parties have complied with the contractually agreed pre- arbitration requirements.  An attempt to enforce pre-arbitration procedures is a positive affirmation of the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, instead of the denial of the agreement.  This  puts  a  prematurity  objection  at  the  opposite  side  of  a  conventional jurisdictional challenge.</li>

<h1><span id="class-4-nuts-and-bolts-of-awards">Class 4 - Nuts and Bolts of Awards</span></h1><p>When dealing with a legal or arbitration case, the first question is: <em>what exactly is in dispute?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the issue <strong>procedural</strong>, or is it <strong>substantive</strong>?</li>
<li>Even within a single claim, there can be <strong>multiple sub-issues</strong> that require separate analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arbitrators often work with a <strong>list of issues</strong> that they must consider carefully when reaching a decision.</p>
<h2><span id="i-arbitrators-role"><strong>I. Arbitrator’s Role</strong></span></h2><h3><span id="a-introduction">A. Introduction</span></h3><h4><span id="1-what-is-an-arbitrators-main-function">1. What is an arbitrator’s main function?</span></h4><p>Render decisions to resolve disputes between the parties </p>
<p>e.g. decisions on procedure, jurisdiction, interim applications and substance of the dispute</p>
<p>The arbitrator is central to the arbitration process, not only as the ultimate decision-maker who delivers the <strong>final award</strong>, but also as a guardian of fairness throughout the proceedings. The arbitration process involves multiple intermediate decisions, such as procedural orders and interim applications. Key responsibilities of an arbitrator include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Managing the Arbitration Process: The arbitrator (or tribunal) must oversee the arbitration proceedings and ensure they unfold in a controlled and efficient manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Addressing Jurisdictional Challenges: If there are disputes regarding the tribunal’s jurisdiction, the arbitrator has the responsibility to rule on such challenges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Handling Substantive and Procedural Matters: Throughout the arbitration, arbitrators address substantive issues raised by the parties as well as procedural issues, such as setting timelines and organizing hearings. For instance, in ICC arbitration the “reference for the first case” sets the procedural framework for the entire process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deciding on Interim Applications: Interim measures might include decisions on asset preservation or other temporary orders intended to maintain the status quo while the arbitration progresses. </p>
<p>Interim applications represent a vital category of non-final decisions within arbitration. Common Types of Interim Applications may include asset preservation orders (e.g., freezing shares) or other measures that “hold the ring” while the process unfolds. Such measures are not permanent but are nonetheless binding, often serving as a precursor to the final award. These applications are instrumental in maintaining fairness and preventing irreparable harm before a final ruling is issued.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some decisions might blur the lines between full and interim resolutions, requiring the arbitrator to carefully discern whether an application is strictly temporary or part of a broader decision-making framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-fundamental-duties-of-the-arbitrator">2. Fundamental Duties of the Arbitrator</span></h4><blockquote>
<p><em>AO s. 46, Model Law Art 18</em></p>
<p>Arbitrators owe the following due process duties to the parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>To treat the parties with equality;</li>
<li>To be independent;</li>
<li>To act fairly and impartially, giving them a reasonable opportunity to present their case and to address the case of their opponent;</li>
<li>To use procedures appropriate for the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delays and expenses, and providing fair means for resolving the dispute.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensuring Fair Party Participation</p>
<p>A fundamental principle in arbitration is that parties must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit their evidence and arguments. Even in cases where one party, such as a respondent, may fail to engage—as illustrated by a scenario where the respondent did not address key payment issues—the arbitrator cannot simply disregard the matter. Instead, a fair process requires setting up clear procedures that allow both sides to make submissions. This ensures that non-engagement by one party does not automatically simplify or prejudice the decision-making process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establishing Procedural Timetables</p>
<p>To guarantee fairness, it is common practice to establish uniform time frames for submissions. For example, both parties may be given an identical period—such as four weeks—to present their evidence. Some arbitration tribunals further enhance efficiency by employing a consolidated timetable, where all parties adhere to a single, clearly defined schedule. This method supports orderly governance of the arbitration process and ensures that all decisions are made in accordance with the rules chosen by the parties, strictly following the agreed procedural framework without arbitrary timing adjustments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>​     </p>
<h4><span id="3-on-what-do-arbitrators-base-their-decisions">3. On what do arbitrators base their decisions?</span></h4><ul>
<li>The relevant contracts</li>
<li>Evidence presented by the parties during the course of the arbitration </li>
<li>The law applicable to the merits and to the procedure</li>
<li>The parties’ correspondence with the arbitral tribunal during the course of the arbitration</li>
<li>Terms of Reference &#x2F; Procedural Orders</li>
<li>List(s) of Issues</li>
</ul>
<p>When making decisions, arbitrators rely heavily on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence Submitted by the Parties: This could include documentary evidence, witness statements, and other factual submissions provided by the parties.</li>
<li>Legal Principles and Rules: Arbitrators apply the governing law and procedural rules agreed upon by the parties during the arbitration.</li>
<li>Terms of Reference and Procedural Orders: These documents (especially in ICC arbitrations) set the procedural framework and reference points for decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the arbitrator considers contractual provisions, the overall purpose of the contract, any registration details, and applicable legal principles. Special attention is paid to the submissions regarding procedural matters and any defenses raised by the parties.</p>
<p>Arbitrators critically evaluate these materials, balancing both parties’ submissions, to reach a fair and impartial decision. Parties thus play a pivotal role by providing the “ingredients” that enable the tribunal to form its determinations.</p>
<h4><span id="4-procedural-fairness-and-single-party-engagement">4. Procedural Fairness and Single-Party Engagement</span></h4><p>The tribunal’s decision-making process involves balancing the evidence and arguments provided by both sides.</p>
<p>A significant challenge arbitrators encounter arises when one party (typically the respondent) fails to engage with the arbitration process. In these situations, the tribunal only has access to the claimant’s evidence and arguments. This absence complicates the tribunal’s ability to fairly scrutinize the claimant’s submissions because it lacks the respondent’s counterarguments.</p>
<p>In such cases, arbitrators often take a more inquisitive approach, asking probing questions and demanding additional supporting evidence from the present party (typically the claimant). This ensures that the tribunal reaches a reasoned decision, even in the absence of the other party. For example, the tribunal may ask claimants to consider potential defenses a respondent might raise, as well as the weaknesses in their own claims. This proactive scrutiny helps fill information gaps caused by single-party participation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether both parties participate, arbitrators must adhere to fundamental principles of procedural fairness. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing all parties with a reasonable opportunity to present their case.</li>
<li>Setting down procedural frameworks (such as aligned timetables) that offer parity to both sides.</li>
<li>Ensuring decisions comply with the procedural rules and legal framework governing the arbitration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arbitrators must avoid any appearance of bias or unfairness, even in situations where one party fails to participate.</p>
<h4><span id="5-temporal-management-framework">5. Temporal Management Framework</span></h4><p>Arbitral tribunals typically implement a <strong>standard four-week submission period</strong> to ensure procedural fairness, while retaining flexibility for customized timetables. Effective case management involves three operational phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Evidence Consolidation Phase: Guaranteeing parties’ substantive rights to present critical materials</p>
</li>
<li><p>Procedural Coordination Phase: Conducting interim conferences to align procedural milestones</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adjudication Finalization Phase: Establishing binding timelines for dispute resolution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This dynamic framework empowers tribunals to exercise <strong>procedural activism</strong>, particularly when adjudicating time-sensitive matters such as extension requests (e.g., documentary submissions) through strict application of party-agreed arbitration rules.</p>

<p>Tribunals are generally required to provide <strong>reasoning</strong> for their awards. However, parties may agree to an award without detailed reasoning.</p>
<p>Not all jurisdictions allow for an award to be issued <strong>without reasoning</strong>, even if the parties agree to it. At the ICC, <strong>Article 321</strong> mandates that awards should include reasoning, making this a <strong>mandatory requirement</strong> in their procedures.</p>
<p>A similar case occurred in the <strong>US</strong> under the <strong>ICDR</strong> rules, where Mimmie Chan J set aside an award in the <strong>A v. B</strong> case. The arbitrator had refused to provide any reasoning for the decision. Mimi Chan determined that the lack of reasoning made it <strong>unfair</strong> to the parties, as they could not understand why they had won or lost.</p>
<p>This highlights the importance of <strong>reasoned decisions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties need to understand <strong>why they won</strong> or <strong>why they lost</strong> in order to have grounds to challenge or <strong>set aside</strong> the award.</li>
<li>Without reasoning, parties are left in the dark and might find it harder to <strong>negotiate</strong> or <strong>enforce</strong> the award.</li>

</blockquote>
<h3><span id="e-default-award">E. “Default” Award</span></h3><p>Decision where one party failed to participate in the proceedings.</p>
<p>In arbitration, it’s critical to <strong>identify the issues</strong>, understand the <strong>disputes</strong>, and recognize any <strong>potential defenses</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tribunal <strong>relies heavily</strong> on the information provided by the parties involved.</li>
<li>When the <strong>respondent doesn’t engage</strong>, the tribunal faces a unique challenge: they <strong>don’t know what they don’t know</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, the tribunal often ends up with even <strong>more questions</strong> than usual because it’s aware of the missing party’s absence. This absence means the tribunal is unable to hear the <strong>respondent’s side</strong>, making the task of decision-making more complex.</p>
<p>Unlike litigation, arbitral tribunals cannot issue “default judgments” akin to court systems. Even if a respondent fails to engage (e.g., neglects to submit defenses), tribunals must:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure due process by serving all notices and materials (UNCITRAL Model Law, Article 24).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluate claims based on evidence provided, per the <em>Kompetenz-Kompetenz</em> principle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>opportunity should be given to each party to present its case and to reply to the arguments of the other</p>
</li>
<li><p>set out applicable rules regarding non-participation (HKIAC Rules Article 26)</p>
</li>
<li><p>keep documentary proof of communications with both parties (record of courier or registered mail delivery &#x2F; attempted delivery)</p>
</li>
<li><p>issue of jurisdiction should be examined and dealt with</p>
</li>
<li><p>decision based on well-founded facts and law</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: In <em>ICC Case No. 2321</em> (2020), the tribunal proceeded ex parte after confirming 11 failed communication attempts with the respondent.</p>

<h3><span id="g-additional-award">G. Additional Award</span></h3><p>Usually, once the final award is made, the tribunal has no further authority (functus officio). </p>
<p>Section 69 AO: within 30 days of the Award, parties can apply for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correction of an award (computational, clerical, typographical or similar) (HKIAC Art. 38)</li>
<li>Interpretation of a specific point or part of an award (HKIAC Art. 39)</li>
<li>Additional award as to claims omitted from the award (HKIAC Art. 40)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="iv-post-award-processes">IV. Post - Award Processes</span></h2><p>Once an award is issued, especially under the ICC rules, both parties generally have an <strong>obligation to honor the award</strong> promptly. However, in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>rare</strong> for the parties to immediately pay the full amount.</li>
<li>Often, the parties will <strong>negotiate</strong> after the award is issued.</li>
<li><strong>Sufficient reasoning</strong> in the award strengthens the position of the <strong>winning party</strong> in these negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="a-the-complexities-of-award-interpretation">A. The Complexities of Award Interpretation</span></h3><p>The interpretation of the award is an area that presents a plethora of possibilities. A common example is related to costs and interest. Often, claimants will include a claim for costs and interest in their submissions. When the tribunal issues the award, it may state that it will award the costs as per the claimant’s success in the case. However, the determination of interest can be more complex. There may be uncertainty as to whether the claimant is entitled to interest and, if so, how much. In such situations, parties may attempt to get the tribunal to clarify these issues. This can be a delicate process, as it is not always easy to obtain a clear answer. If a party requests an interpretation or clarification, they may face challenges. For instance, the opposing party may raise objections, and in some institutions like those in China, there is an additional process before a correction can be made. During this time, the party may be wasting valuable time that could be used for enforcing the award. This is a significant concern, considering that there are time limits for the enforcement of awards. Thus, while the process of interpretation and correction offers possibilities for resolving uncertainties, it is not a straightforward one.</p>
<h3><span id="b-time-frames-for-award-delivery">B. Time Frames for Award Delivery</span></h3><p>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the tribunal is not subject to a time limit for delivery of the award (in HK). </p>
<p>If the arbitration agreement imposes a time limit to render an award, Section 72 of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) provides that the court may extend that time limit, regardless of whether it has expired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>ICC Article 31</strong><br>The time limit within which the arbitral tribunal must render its final award is six months. Such time limit shall start to run from the date of the last signature by the arbitral tribunal or by the parties of the Terms of Reference or, in the case of application of Article 23(3), the date of the notification to the arbitral tribunal by the Secretariat of the approval of the Terms of Reference by the Court. The Court may fix a different time limit based upon the procedural timetable established pursuant to Article 24(2).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>HKIAC Articles 31.1 and 31.2</strong><br>When it is satisfied that the parties have had a reasonable opportunity to present their case, whether in relation to the entire proceedings or a discrete phase of the proceedings, and no later than 45 days from the last directed substantive oral or written submissions in respect of the entire proceedings or the discrete phase of the proceedings (excluding submissions on costs under Article 34), the arbitral tribunal shall declare the proceedings or the relevant phase of the proceedings closed.<br>Once the proceedings are declared closed, the arbitral tribunal shall inform HKIAC and the parties of the anticipated date by which an award will be communicated to the parties. The date of rendering the award shall be no later than three months from the date when the arbitral tribunal declares the entire proceedings or the relevant phase of the proceedings closed, as applicable. This time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or, in appropriate circumstances, by HKIAC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comparison, in a court setting, such as in Hong Kong, if there is a 5 - day trial, it is not always easy to predict how long it will take for the court to issue a judgment. Estimates suggest that for medium to large cases, it could take around three months, and in some complex cases, it may even take up to a year and a half. </p>
<p>In the context of arbitration, people generally expect the award to be issued around three months after the relevant proceedings, although this can vary significantly. </p>
<p>In practice, the time it takes to receive an award depends on various factors, including the complexity of the case, the efficiency of the arbitration institution, and the actions of the parties involved. Some parties may want to delay the process, while others may be eager to receive the award promptly. There have been cases in other institutions (not in Hong Kong) where the process has taken more than a year, highlighting the variability in the time frames for arbitration awards.</p>
<h3><span id="c-transformative-changes-in-hkiac-rules">C. Transformative Changes in HKIAC Rules</span></h3><p>The Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) has witnessed a significant transition in its rules, which is a matter of great importance in the arbitration landscape. In the past, the HKIAC rules had a guidance suggesting that the tribunal should issue an award within approximately three months after the conclusion of the proceedings. In theory, once all the necessary steps of the arbitration process were completed, and there were no further outstanding matters, the parties could expect to receive the award within this three - month timeframe. However, this led to several issues.</p>
<p>There were instances where, despite the parties having submitted all required materials, the tribunal did not issue the award within the stipulated three months. This delay could be due to various reasons, some of which might not be malicious but rather genuine difficulties faced by the tribunal. Nevertheless, it caused problems for the parties, who had to endure additional waiting times and potential uncertainties. To address this, the HKIAC has now made a change. The new rule aims to accelerate the process, requiring the tribunal to close the proceedings and issue an award within 45 days from the date when all substantial submissions have been made. This is a significant step forward in ensuring more timely resolutions in arbitration cases, and the HKIAC is among the first institutions to take such a proactive approach in dealing with this common issue in the arbitration world.</p>
<h2><span id="v-remedies">V. Remedies</span></h2><p>In a typical arbitration process, once an award is issued, the hope is that all parties are satisfied. However, in reality, this is not always the case. Sometimes, unforeseen circumstances arise that may require further action. There is a process known as the request for various actions related to the award, such as correction or interpretation of specific points. For example, if the decision base in the award is unclear, parties may try to rely on this process to seek clarification. This could be crucial in cases where the outcome of the award has significant implications for the parties involved.</p>
<p><strong>Tribunals have wide discretion</strong> in determining the appropriate measures, but their authority is constrained by the <strong>scope of the arbitration agreement</strong> or the <strong>parties’ agreement</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are an arbitrator, it helps if legal counsel presents <strong>clear and specific</strong> relief requests. This makes the tribunal’s job easier and ensures the requested relief is precisely what is required.</p>
<h3><span id="a-interim-measures">A. Interim measures</span></h3><p>The topic of budgets and the types of remedies allowed in arbitration, especially in the context of requests for interim measures, is crucial. Arbitral tribunals generally possess a wide range of discretion when determining the appropriate measures to take. However, it is essential to note that the tribunal’s power is derived from the scope of the parties’ agreement. In other words, the tribunal cannot issue an order or award that goes beyond what the parties have consented to, unless it falls within the specific parameters of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<h4><span id="1-various-types-of-interim-measures">1. Various Types of Interim Measures</span></h4><p>Tribunals generally have a wide discretion in determining the appropriate measures. </p>
<p>The various types of interim measures can be categorised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orders preserving the status quo</li>
<li>Orders requiring specific performance</li>
<li>Orders requiring security for underlying claims</li>
<li>Orders requiring security for legal costs</li>
<li>Orders for preservation or inspection of property</li>
<li>Enforcement of confidentiality obligations</li>
<li>Orders for interim payment</li>
<li>Anti-suit orders - order issued by the arbitral tribunal that prevents an opposing party from commencing or continuing a proceeding in another jurisdiction or forum</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous types of interim measures available in arbitration. For example, in situations where a party wants to prevent the other party from dissipating their assets, an order can be sought to maintain the status quo. This ensures that the assets are preserved, and the financial position of the parties remains stable until the final resolution of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Orders for specific performance are also common. Instead of allowing a party to simply ignore their contractual obligations, the tribunal can require them to perform a particular action as specified in the contract. This is useful when the non - performance of a specific task has a significant impact on the other party’s interests.</p>
<p>Another type of interim measure involves requests for security related to underlying claims. This could be in the form of requiring a party to provide collateral or a guarantee to cover potential damages or losses. Additionally, orders for the preservation or inspection of property can be crucial, especially in cases where the condition or existence of the property is in dispute.</p>
<p>Enforcement of confidentiality obligations is another important aspect. In some arbitration cases, especially those involving sensitive business information or personal matters, maintaining confidentiality is of utmost importance. The tribunal can issue orders to ensure that the parties and any involved third parties adhere to strict confidentiality requirements.</p>
<p>Orders for payment are also among the available interim measures. In cases where there is an urgent need for funds, such as to cover ongoing expenses related to the arbitration or to compensate for losses suffered immediately, a tribunal can order one party to make a payment to the other.</p>
<h4><span id="2-importance-of-clear-specification-by-parties">2. Importance of Clear Specification by Parties</span></h4><p>For a party seeking interim measures in arbitration, it is of the essence to clearly specify what they are requesting. As an arbitrator, having a precise understanding of the party’s needs and expectations is crucial for making a well - informed decision. Vague or ambiguous requests can lead to misunderstandings and potentially result in the tribunal issuing an order that does not fully address the party’s concerns. </p>
<p>Therefore, parties should take the time to clearly define the nature, scope, and purpose of the interim measures they are seeking, ensuring that their requests align with the overall goals of the arbitration and the terms of the parties’ agreement.</p>

Should the award contain reasoning?</span></h4><p>Article 32(1) of the ICC Rules stipulates that it is almost a universal principle that arbitral awards should state the reasons for the tribunal’s decision and the relief ordered by the tribunal (dispositive section). Specifically, the article states, “The award shall state the reasons upon which it is based.”</p>
<p>The HKIAC Rules provide that “35.4 An award shall state the reasons upon which it is based unless the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given.” </p>
<p>The failure to include reasons may lead to the challenge or setting aside of the award, as demonstrated in the case of A v. B and Others [2024] HKCFI 751.</p>
<h4><span id="2-unanimity-or-majority-or-neither">2. Unanimity or Majority or Neither?</span></h4><p>According to HKIAC rules (Article 33) and ICC rules (Article 321), if there is more than one arbitrator, the award must be made by majority. For a sole arbitrator, there is no issue of majority or unanimity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>HKIAC Rules: Art 33</strong><br>33.1 When there is more than one arbitrator, any award or other decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be made by a majority of the arbitrators. If there is no majority, the award shall be made by the presiding arbitrator alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For cases with <strong>three arbitrators</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The decision <strong>must be made by the majority</strong>, not the minority, and there cannot be a <strong>tie</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Two-member arbitrator panels</strong> have emerged in some cases, where each arbitrator is aligned with one of the two parties. This creates a situation where there is a <strong>split</strong> decision, and the <strong>third arbitrator</strong> may be required to cast the deciding vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>ICC Rules</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Under Article 32(1) : Making of the Award</strong><br>When the arbitral tribunal is composed of more than one arbitrator, an award is made by a majority decision. If there is no majority, the award shall be made by the president of the arbitral tribunal alone. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most arbitration laws provide that the parties can agree otherwise. </p>
<h4><span id="3-what-happens-when-the-majority-cannot-be-reached">3. What happens when the majority cannot be reached?</span></h4><h5><span id="1-dissenting-opinions">(1) Dissenting opinions</span></h5><p>In certain cases, an arbitrator may disagree with the majority’s opinion and still wish to <strong>publish their view</strong>. In such cases, the arbitrator can issue a <strong>dissenting opinion</strong>. This allows for the inclusion of alternative views and provides a <strong>complete record</strong> of the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Most arbitration legislation does not address dissenting opinions. However, in some countries like the UAE, dissenting opinions must be attached to the final award for it to be valid.</p>
<p><strong>Dissenting opinions</strong> are commonly seen when arbitrators disagree with the majority view, providing transparency and an opportunity for further analysis.</p>
<p>There was an unusual case under <strong>ICC rules</strong> where the arbitration agreement called for <strong>seven arbitrators</strong>. In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parties nominated <strong>seven arbitrators</strong>.</li>
<li>However, the question arose: what happens when the panel cannot reach a <strong>majority</strong> decision, or when an <strong>even number</strong> of arbitrators creates a <strong>tie</strong>?</li>
<li>This can lead to difficult procedural questions, particularly about how to proceed with a <strong>split</strong> decision.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="2-truncated-tribunals">(2) Truncated tribunals</span></h5><p>When an arbitrator is no longer able to participate, the tribunal might become <strong>truncated</strong>, meaning it is reduced to fewer members. This could occur if an arbitrator <strong>passes away</strong> or for other reasons such as <strong>resignation</strong>.</p>
<p>In cases where a <strong>majority</strong> decision cannot be reached, or when an arbitrator must be replaced, the <strong>procedures</strong> for how to proceed can vary by <strong>jurisdiction</strong>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <strong>majority decision</strong> cannot be achieved, there is a need to decide how to <strong>resolve</strong> the situation. In some cases, an additional arbitrator might be appointed.</li>
<li>In situations where an arbitrator must be replaced mid-proceeding, the procedure varies depending on the <strong>arbitration rules</strong> and the stage of the proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Article <strong>15(4)</strong> of the <strong>ICC Rules</strong> allows for the continuation of proceedings with a <strong>truncated tribunal</strong>. This provision allows a tribunal to issue an award <strong>without the third arbitrator</strong> if all parties agree, as long as there is a majority decision from the remaining arbitrators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ICC Rules Article 15(4)</strong><br>When an arbitrator is to be replaced, the Court has discretion to decide whether or not to follow the original nominating process. Once reconstituted, and after having invited the parties to comment, the arbitral tribunal shall determine if and to what extent prior proceedings shall be repeated before the reconstituted arbitral tribunal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A noteworthy example occurred under the <strong>ICC</strong> rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The tribunal had three arbitrators: two <strong>Supreme Court justices from India</strong> and one <strong>President from Switzerland</strong>. As the proceedings were closing and the tribunal was deliberating, one of the <strong>Indian justices</strong> tragically passed away. The remaining two arbitrators agreed that the <strong>deceased arbitrator</strong> had already expressed an opinion on how the award should be decided.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because of the <strong>stage of the arbitration</strong>, the parties agreed that the ICC would not appoint a replacement for the third arbitrator. The remaining two arbitrators issued a <strong>majority award</strong> as a <strong>truncated tribunal</strong>. However, the <strong>opinion of the deceased arbitrator</strong> was not reflected in the final award, and the parties never knew what that arbitrator’s position had been.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-how-and-where-should-arbitrators-deliberate">4. How and where should arbitrators deliberate?</span></h4><p>One of the unique aspects of <strong>international arbitration</strong> is the flexibility in where arbitrators can <strong>deliberate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>place of arbitration</strong> does not necessarily determine where the <strong>deliberations</strong> must take place.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitration proceedings</strong> can take place anywhere in the world, so the tribunal can choose <strong>different locations</strong> for hearings and deliberations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This flexibility has made arbitration a <strong>globally convenient</strong> method of dispute resolution, as it allows parties and arbitrators to avoid being tied to a single location, instead choosing a neutral venue that suits both sides.</p>
<p>Article 18(3) of the ICC Rules: “The arbitral tribunal may deliberate at any location it considers appropriate.”</p>
<p>Failure to participate in the deliberations can in some cases lead to removal of an arbitrator.</p>
<p>Before the onset of <strong>COVID-19</strong>, many tribunals took advantage of the flexibility offered by the <strong>place of arbitration</strong>. The place of arbitration didn’t necessarily need to be where the tribunal members were located, and it was quite common for <strong>tribunals to travel</strong> to the designated place of arbitration for hearings and deliberations. However, the <strong>rules</strong> themselves allow the tribunal to deliberate anywhere they deem appropriate. This means the tribunal has the <strong>discretion to deliberate</strong> in any location, regardless of the designated arbitration venue.</p>
<p>With the <strong>pandemic</strong> changing the way we work, <strong>virtual deliberations</strong> have become a regular practice. For example, in a recent case, a tribunal <strong>deliberated online</strong> using <strong>Zoom</strong>. One arbitrator was based in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, another in <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, and the third in <strong>Europe</strong>, meaning no one had to travel for the deliberations. This is a direct consequence of the pandemic, making <strong>remote arbitration</strong> not just possible but increasingly common.</p>
<h4><span id="5-how-long-may-the-arbitral-tribunal-deliberate">5. How long may the arbitral tribunal deliberate?</span></h4><p>Article 31.1 of the ICC Rules – Time Limit for Rendering Final Awards (6 months from TOR)</p>
<p>Article 31.2 of the HKIAC Rules – Time Limit for Rendering Final Award (3 months from closing of proceedings)</p>
<p>In the context of <strong>ICC rules</strong>, the tribunal generally has a <strong>six-month time limit</strong> to issue an award, starting from when the terms of reference are signed. However, the <strong>ICC court</strong> has the <strong>discretion</strong> to grant extensions to this time limit in <strong>exceptional circumstances</strong>.</p>
<p>The process for issuing an award in ICC arbitration works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The tribunal <strong>submits a draft award</strong> well in advance of the time limit.</li>
<li>The <strong>ICC court</strong> reviews the draft award, provides comments, and then decides whether to approve it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This review process can take anywhere from a single day to several months, depending on the complexity of the case and whether there is any disagreement among the ICC court members.</p>
<p>While extensions are possible for complex cases, there is an interesting situation where tribunal members might ask for more time repeatedly due to the complexity of the matter. This extra time is often required to ensure that the award is sufficiently detailed to withstand scrutiny by the ICC court.</p>
<p>An interesting phenomenon is the speed of the review process in some cases. For example, the lecturer has personally seen an award get approved in one day. This wasn’t because the award was simple, but because the draft award was accidentally sent to the parties. This led to an unintentional leak of the draft award, but because of the pressure to get the award approved quickly, the award was reviewed and issued that same day.</p>
<p>Sometimes, tribunals may inadvertently send out drafts of the award, especially if they are not careful with their email communications. For example, there have been incidents where arbitrators accidentally copy all parties when sending the draft award to the institution for review. In one case, an arbitrator replied all with the draft award twice, which resulted in the parties receiving the award prematurely.</p>
<p>As a representing lawyer, when you receive such a draft, there is an inherent professional dilemma: do you delete the email as instructed, or do you take a moment to read the award and see if your client won? Of course, professional ethics dictate that you should delete it, but human curiosity often takes over.</p>
<p>In a particularly extreme case, the ICC court was forced to review and approve a 150-page award on the same day to make sure it was issued promptly. This incident underscores how, in certain situations, even a complex award can be processed and issued in a very short time frame if the circumstances demand it.</p>

<li>There is a distinction between the statutory procedure for enforcement under section 2GG of the old Arbitration Ordinance (which is substantially the same as section 84 of the current Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609)) and a common law action on an award. </li>
<li>The statutory enforcement procedure is mechanistic in the sense that the enforcing court cannot go beyond the terms of the award. </li>
<li>In contrast, in a common law action, the court has power to grant any relief it considers appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vi-finality">VI. Finality</span></h2><p>One of the core benefits of arbitration that is often highlighted is the finality of the award. In arbitration, the expectation is that once a final or partial award is issued, it should resolve the dispute in a conclusive manner. As an arbitrator, one of the things I used to tell my clients is that the award is not subject to appeal just because they believe the law was applied incorrectly. This is part of the reason why it’s critical to choose a good arbitrator, ensure that your submissions are clear, and make sure that all arguments are adequately presented.</p>
<p>In fact, finality is one of the reasons why arbitration is considered better than other forms of dispute resolution, as evidenced by surveys like the 2018 Whiten Case survey. The ability to issue a final and binding award is highly valued by parties seeking certainty. Additionally, the enforceability of arbitration awards is another major advantage, as they are enforceable in over 270 jurisdictions under the New York Convention.</p>

<h3><span id="a-appeals-mechanism">A. Appeals Mechanism?</span></h3><p>Under various arbitration rules, including <strong>Section 73</strong> of the <strong>Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance</strong> and <strong>rules 35.2 (HPIC)</strong> and <strong>35.6 (ICC)</strong>, it is clear that an arbitration award is <strong>final</strong> and <strong>binding</strong> unless otherwise agreed by the parties. This means that the <strong>award must be written</strong>, and it <strong>binds</strong> not only the parties but also any <strong>person claiming through or under them</strong>. The concept of <strong>finality</strong> is central to arbitration, creating an expectation that once an award is issued, there is no further recourse to change or challenge it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 73 of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Effect of award</li>
</ol>
<p>   (1)Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an award made by an arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and binding both on—</p>

<pre><code>(2) Subsection (1) does not affect the right of a person to challenge the award-

<ul>
<li>HKIAC: Awards shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties and any person claiming through or under any of the parties.</li>
<li>ICC: Every award shall be binding on the parties.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The idea of allowing parties to appeal an arbitration award on points of law is one that has evolved in different jurisdictions. While finality is traditionally considered a cornerstone of arbitration, some jurisdictions and institutions have been experimenting with allowing greater flexibility for appeals or corrections, often based on party autonomy or specific agreements between parties. Let’s break down some of the developments in different regions, particularly focusing on Singapore, the UK, and other arbitral institutions.</p>
<p>Hong Kong → express opt-in to Schedule 2 by Parties (2011 Hong Kong AO):</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 4 of Sch 2 (Challenging arbitral award on ground of serious irregularity)</li>
<li>Section 4 of Sch 2 (Appeal against arbitral award on question of law)</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="1-singapores-approach-to-appeal-on-a-question-of-law">1. Singapore’s Approach to Appeal on a Question of Law</span></h4><p>Singapore: not allowed</p>
<ul>
<li>2019, Ministry of Law considered amendment to the International Arbitration Act to allow for appeals on errors of law on an ‘opt-in’ basis similar to Hong Kong.</li>
<li>Not included in 2020 revised IAA.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Singapore, the <strong>domestic arbitration law</strong> does provide for an appeal on a <strong>question of law</strong>. However, this is not available in <strong>international arbitration</strong> unless specifically agreed upon by the parties, which is often a rare occurrence in practice.</p>
<p>In 2019, the <strong>Ministry of Law</strong> in Singapore <strong>considered amending the law</strong> to allow appeals on a question of law in <strong>international arbitration</strong>. This was based on the fact that the <strong>domestic arbitration law</strong> had this provision, but the <strong>2020 revision of the Arbitration Act</strong> did not extend this right to international arbitration.</p>
<p>This highlights the ongoing <strong>debate</strong> on whether allowing appeals on points of law undermines the key benefit of <strong>finality</strong> in arbitration, or if it improves fairness by allowing a higher court to review legal interpretations. As of now, Singapore has <strong>not included</strong> the ability to appeal on a question of law in international cases.</p>
<h4><span id="2-the-uks-arbitration-act-1996-appeal-on-points-of-law">2. The UK’s Arbitration Act 1996: Appeal on Points of Law</span></h4><p>Section 69 of the UK Arbitration Act 1996 provides parties to an arbitration seated in England &amp; Wales with an opportunity to appeal against an award on a point of law.</p>
<ul>
<li>No need to opt-in</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>UK’s Arbitration Act 1996</strong> does allow for an appeal on a <strong>point of law</strong>, provided certain conditions are met. This is unique compared to many other jurisdictions, as it provides a mechanism for <strong>judicial review</strong> of <strong>legal errors</strong> in arbitration awards.</p>
<p>However, this appeal is not automatic. The parties must demonstrate that the legal error has <strong>significant consequences</strong> on the outcome of the case. Even then, the <strong>court will not automatically overturn the tribunal’s decision</strong> but will consider the implications of the legal error in the broader context of the dispute.</p>
<p>While this option exists, it is still <strong>rarely exercised</strong>, as many parties prefer the <strong>finality</strong> arbitration provides, and the procedural barriers to appealing can be substantial. The fact that the option exists, though, provides an additional layer of <strong>legal recourse</strong> for those who feel that an <strong>error of law</strong> has occurred.</p>
<h4><span id="3-institutional-internal-appeal-procedures-a-growing-trend">3. Institutional Internal Appeal Procedures: A Growing Trend</span></h4><p>Arbitral Institutions - Internal appellate procedures</p>
<ul>
<li>CPR, JAMS, AAA → US based</li>
<li>SCA, ECA → European based</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, <strong>arbitral institutions</strong> have started to introduce <strong>internal appellate procedures</strong> within their own <strong>rules</strong>. This allows for an <strong>appeal within the institution itself</strong>, rather than going through national courts.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPR JAMS</strong> and <strong>ICDR-AAA</strong> in the <strong>US</strong> have internal procedures for appealing awards, provided that both parties agree to this in their arbitration agreement.</li>
<li>In <strong>Europe</strong>, both the <strong>Spanish Court of Arbitration</strong> and the <strong>European Court of Arbitration</strong> offer similar mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These procedures are based on the principle of <strong>party autonomy</strong>—meaning the parties can agree in advance to allow a <strong>review</strong> or <strong>appeal</strong> process. This allows for some flexibility and may appeal to parties seeking more <strong>certainty</strong> or <strong>fairness</strong> in their disputes.</p>
<h3><span id="b-the-possibility-of-setting-aside-an-award">B. The Possibility of Setting Aside an Award</span></h3><p>While <strong>finality</strong> is a key benefit, the <strong>possibility of setting aside an award</strong> does exist in certain circumstances. In <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, under <strong>Section 81</strong> of the Arbitration Ordinance, there are very limited grounds for <strong>setting aside</strong> an award, as there are in many jurisdictions worldwide. The grounds for setting aside an award are typically <strong>narrow</strong> and focused on <strong>egregious procedural issues</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of notification</strong></li>
<li><strong>Failure to provide due process</strong></li>
<li><strong>Public policy violations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These issues must be serious enough to warrant the setting aside of an award. Therefore, while it’s possible to challenge the award in these cases, it is rare for the challenge to succeed unless there is something particularly egregious about the process.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Hong Kong’s arbitration system is that negative jurisdictional decisions—for instance, when a tribunal rules that it does not have jurisdiction over a party—cannot be set aside under current law. It highlights the complexity of arbitration law and its evolving nature. Even though there are mechanisms in place to challenge awards, jurisdictional decisions made during the arbitration process are generally not subject to setting aside.</p>
<p>However, parties often try to find creative ways to challenge such decisions. In these situations, counsel may come up with novel arguments to dispute the tribunal’s jurisdiction, but the law, as it stands in Hong Kong, does not allow the setting aside of such jurisdictional decisions.</p>
<h3><span id="c-correctionx2fclarification-of-award">C. Correction&#x2F;Clarification of award?</span></h3><p>Even after an <strong>award</strong> is issued, there are still opportunities for <strong>correction</strong> or <strong>clarification</strong>. This is especially true when there are ambiguities in the award that need interpretation.</p>
<p>For example, the <strong>ICC</strong> and <strong>SIAC</strong> both allow for <strong>correction</strong> or <strong>interpretation</strong> of an award, typically to resolve <strong>clerical errors</strong> or to provide clarity on specific points. This ensures that the award is properly understood and implemented. However, this is a <strong>limited</strong> process and does not involve a <strong>reassessment</strong> of the substance of the case.</p>
<p>For <strong>ad hoc arbitration</strong>—where there may not be an overseeing institution—there are <strong>more applications</strong> for corrections or clarifications. Without an institution to review the award, the parties may resort to seeking judicial intervention to correct or clarify the award.</p>
<p>Section 69 of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) (Article 11 of UNCITRAL Model Law):</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Article 33.   Correction and interpretation of award; additional award</strong><br>(1) Within thirty days of receipt of the award, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties:<br>(a) a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct in the award any errors in computation, any clerical or typographical errors or any errors of similar nature;<br>(b) if so agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the award.<br>If the arbitral tribunal considers the request to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days of receipt of the request. The interpretation shall form part of the award.<br>(2) The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in paragraph (1)(a) of this article on its own initiative within thirty days of the date of the award.<br>(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party, with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days of receipt of the award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the award. If the arbitral tribunal considers the request to be justified, it shall make the additional award within sixty days.</p>

<p>HKIAC Rules Articles 38, 39, 40 and ICC Rules Article 36 (correction of award, interpretation of award, additional awards)</p>
<p>Section 69 of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) (Article 11 of UNCITRAL Model Law)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>HKIAC Rules Articles 38, 39, 40 and ICC Rules Article 36</p>
<p>A significant <strong>benefit</strong> of using <strong>institutional arbitration</strong> (e.g., <strong>ICC</strong>, <strong>SIAC</strong>, <strong>CAC</strong>) is that the institution often <strong>scrutinizes the award</strong> before it is issued. This helps <strong>minimize</strong> the need for <strong>corrections</strong> or <strong>interpretations</strong> of the award after it’s been rendered. The <strong>institutional oversight</strong> serves as a safeguard to ensure the award is legally sound and properly written.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>ad hoc arbitrations</strong>, where there is no overseeing body, often see <strong>more applications</strong> for <strong>correction</strong> or <strong>interpretation</strong> of the award. This is because there is no institution to review the award before it is issued, and parties may feel the need to clarify certain points or challenge errors in the decision-making process.</p>
<h3><span id="d-opting-into-additional-grounds-for-challenge">D. Opting Into Additional Grounds for Challenge</span></h3><p>In a fascinating aspect of <strong>Hong Kong law</strong>, parties can opt into <strong>Schedule 2 of the Arbitration Ordinance</strong> when they enter into their arbitration agreement or even during the arbitration process itself. Opting into this schedule can give parties <strong>more recourse</strong> to challenge the award. Under Schedule 2, parties can challenge an award on the following grounds:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Serious irregularity</strong> in the process.</li>
<li>The ability to <strong>appeal</strong> the award based on <strong>a question of law</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This offers <strong>more opportunities</strong> for a party to seek a review or correction of an award, especially in cases where they believe there were significant errors in the <strong>legal reasoning</strong> or procedural fairness.</p>
<hr>
<h1><span id="class-5-preliminary-meeting">Class 5 - Preliminary Meeting</span></h1><p>One of the tribunal’s first tasks after constitution is to set the procedural framework for the arbitration. This often begins with a <strong>procedural meeting</strong> or <strong>case management conference</strong>, where the tribunal and parties agree on the structure and timeline of the proceedings.</p>
<h2><span id="i-purpose-of-the-preliminary-meeting">I. Purpose of the Preliminary Meeting</span></h2><p>The legal basis for procedural matters in Hong Kong arbitration includes <strong>Section 47 of the Arbitration Ordinance</strong>, which emphasizes two key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal treatment of parties</li>
<li>Fair and efficient process, avoid unnecessary delay and expense</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609)</strong><br> <strong>Section 47: Article 19 of UNCITRAL Model Law (Determination of rules of procedure)</strong><br>(1) Subject to the provisions of this Law, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings.<br>(2) If or to the extent that there is no such agreement of the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, conduct the arbitration in the manner that it considers appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="a-upholding-equality-fairness-amp-efficiency-in-arbitration">A. Upholding Equality, Fairness &amp; Efficiency in Arbitration</span></h3><p>The principles mentioned above are echoed in <strong>Section 46</strong>, which further requires that tribunals act <strong>independently and impartially</strong>, ensuring that each party has a <strong>reasonable opportunity to present its case</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Arbitration Ordinance, Section 46: Article 18 of UNCITRAL Model Law (Equal treatment of parties)</strong><br>(2) The parties must be treated with equality<br>(3) When conducting arbitral proceedings… the arbitral tribunal is required-<br>(a) to be independent;<br>(b) to act fairly and impartially as between the parties, giving them a reasonable opportunity to present their cases and to deal with the cases of their opponents; and<br>(c) to use procedures that are appropriate to the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as to provide a fair means for resolving the dispute to which the arbitral proceedings relate. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tribunal has wide discretion in shaping the procedural framework. This includes decisions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>admissibility and relevance of evidence</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>format</strong> and <strong>timetable</strong> of submissions</li>
<li>Whether hearings are necessary or matters can be resolved on paper</li>
</ul>
<p>This discretion is supported by commonly used institutional rules, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HKIAC Rules</strong>: Article 13 allows broad powers to manage proceedings.</li>
<li><strong>ICC and UNCITRAL Rules</strong>: Both confirm the tribunal’s authority over procedure.<ul>
<li>Articles 22 and 24 of the 2021 ICC Rules and ICC Note to Parties and Arbitral Tribunals on the Conduct of the Arbitration under the ICC Rules of Arbitration (January 2021)</li>
<li>Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, with great discretion comes responsibility. Tribunals must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid any appearance of bias or procedural unfairness</li>
<li>Ensure their conduct does not provide grounds for challenge of the final award</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-establishing-a-clear-roadmap">B. Establishing a Clear Roadmap</span></h3><p>Parties need a road-map to resolve the dispute.  The procedural conference essentially serves as the <strong>roadmap for the arbitration</strong>. It sets out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>timeline for submissions and hearings</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mode of communication</strong> between parties and with the tribunal</li>
<li><strong>Document production protocols</strong></li>
<li>Any initial applications (e.g. challenges to jurisdiction or interim relief)</li>
</ul>
<p>The road-map should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understood by the Parties (and stakeholders) </li>
<li>Focused on the ultimate objective of the Parties </li>
<li>Strategic and effective</li>
<li>Time and cost efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the meeting, tribunals usually require parties to <strong>consult with each other</strong> to:</p>

<li>Narrow down areas of disagreement</li>
<li>Prepare a <strong>joint draft agenda</strong> or <strong>procedural proposal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Parties may be invited to submit <strong>brief written statements</strong> outlining their positions in advance, allowing the tribunal to prepare and engage meaningfully during the hearing. A draft agenda is often prepared before the meeting, outlining points of agreement and dispute. This allows parties to be well-prepared and enables the tribunal to consider the issues in advance, asking relevant questions during the meeting.</p>
<p>Capture agreed common procedural ground between Parties Tribunal needs to resolve disagreements.</p>
<p>Decisions need to be discussed and captured for all Parties.</p>
<h3><span id="c-practicalities">C. Practicalities</span></h3><ul>
<li><p>Needs to be done shortly after tribunal constituted.</p>
<p>Procedural meetings, which set the tone for the arbitration, should be scheduled as soon as the tribunal is constituted. Such meetings help keep the process moving forward without delays, addressing procedural issues early to avoid disputes later on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parties can engage directly to agree issues reduce costs draft a PO1.</p>
<p>Following the procedural meeting, the tribunal typically issues <strong>Procedural Order No. 1</strong>, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Records all procedural decisions made</li>
<li>Includes a detailed <strong>arbitration timetable</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This order forms the backbone of the arbitration and is critical for managing expectations and ensuring a smooth process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tribunals usually request short submissions to get input for common disputed issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-person hearing often dispensed with to save costs Frequently conducted by telephone or video conference Agreed procedure and steps agreed usually set out in Procedural Order No. 1.</p>
<p>Most procedural meetings are conducted <strong>virtually</strong> (via videoconference or telephone), especially in international arbitration where participants span multiple jurisdictions and time zones. <strong>Video conferencing</strong> is often preferred as it facilitates better communication and allows parties to observe the tribunal’s reactions.</p>
<p><strong>In-person meetings</strong> may still occur, particularly when substantive preliminary issues arise (e.g. jurisdictional challenges).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clients can attend these meetings alongside their legal counsel, but it is critical that <strong>seasoned arbitration practitioners</strong> advocate clearly to avoid any misunderstanding, especially due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language barriers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cultural differences in communication style</strong>, which may influence perceptions of strength or credibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="d-practical-problems">D. Practical Problems</span></h3><p>While the procedural meeting is intended to establish certainty, several issues can arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires the parties and tribunal at outset to have a vision of what a fair and effective process looks like for them</li>
<li>The tribunal may not know enough about the dispute to have a strong view on effective conduct of the proceedings.</li>
<li>Preliminary documents in arbitration (e.g. NoA&#x2F;RFA, Answer) may not capture all claims&#x2F;arguments. Claims, counterclaims, and challenges may be raised at later stages, which may require the timetable to be revised.</li>
<li>Requirement for summary of claims in the Terms of Reference in ICC cases and limited ability to introduce new claims (Art. 23 of the ICC Rules) Tribunal may not appreciate cultural preferences, individual preferences, personalities and style at an early stage</li>
<li>The parties and tribunal may be focused on creating a ‘positive’first impression</li>
<li>Parties may <strong>miss deadlines</strong> or request extensions due to unforeseen developments</li>
</ul>
<p>While the tribunal strives to set a clear and firm timetable, adjustments may be necessary as the arbitration progresses. Unexpected developments, like new claims or interim applications, can require modifications to the timetable. The tribunal must retain some flexibility to address these changes, but delays without good cause may result in the tribunal enforcing stricter timelines.</p>
<h2><span id="ii-agenda-for-the-preliminary-meeting">II. Agenda for the Preliminary Meeting</span></h2><p>During the preliminary meeting, several key issues are typically addressed to establish the procedural framework of the arbitration. Below are the most common agenda items:</p>
<p><img src="/../images/6157/image-20250421222725176.png" alt="image-20250421222725176"></p>
<p>At the <strong>first preliminary meeting</strong>, the tribunal typically circulates a <strong>draft agenda</strong> to the parties for feedback. The goal is to streamline the process and resolve non-disputed issues first, such as the overall <strong>adoption of arbitration rules</strong> and procedural matters. In this case, the tribunal suggested the <strong>adoption of IBA Rules of Evidence</strong> as a guideline for handling evidential issues, although this was not mandatory for the parties.</p>
<p>Once the procedural framework was settled, the tribunal moved on to address more substantive matters that had been flagged in the <strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>.</p>
<h3><span id="a-arbitration-agreement">A. Arbitration Agreement</span></h3><ul>
<li><p>The tribunal must confirm the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement. If there is any dispute between the parties on this point, it directly affects the tribunal’s jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Important points may have to be agreed (or argued) at the preliminary hearing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Place of the arbitration (seat of the arbitration place for the hearing)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Language and Seat of Arbitration</p>
<p>Usually stipulated in the arbitration agreement. If not, parties must agree or the tribunal will decide. </p>
<p>Language choice affects submissions, hearings, and translations, and can have strategic implications, especially in cross-border disputes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Arbitration Rules to be applied</p>
</li>
<li><p>Governing Law</p>
<p>This may differ from the law governing the substantive contract. If not specified, parties must address this, as it influences how procedural issues are resolved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-jurisdiction-of-the-tribunal">B. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal</span></h3><p>If a party disputes the tribunal’s jurisdiction, this must be raised before the <strong>statement of defense</strong> under the Arbitration Ordinance. This is where the principle of <strong>kompetenz-kompetenz</strong> applies: the tribunal has the authority to rule on its own jurisdiction without the need for court intervention. Efficiency is enhanced by this principle, keeping the arbitration self-contained and avoiding delays caused by parallel court proceedings.</p>

<h3><span id="c-interim-measures">C. Interim Measures</span></h3><p>Statutory basis – AO Art. 35</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any temporary measure .. by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain or restore the status quo</li>
<li>Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking any action that is likely to cause, harm or prejudice to the arbitral process itself</li>
<li>Provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied</li>
<li>Preserve evidence</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An interim measure is a <strong>temporary decision</strong> made by the arbitral tribunal <strong>before the final award</strong>. It helps to protect the parties’ rights or the arbitration process while the dispute is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Parties often seek to maintain the <strong>status quo</strong> pending the outcome of arbitration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Freezing Orders</strong>: To prevent a respondent from dissipating assets, especially if enforcement is anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation of Evidence</strong>: To ensure crucial documents or materials are not destroyed or tampered with.</li>
<li><strong>Injunctions</strong>: To prevent specific actions that may harm the other party’s interests (e.g., reducing company value).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timing</strong>: Requests should be raised at or before the preliminary meeting. The tribunal (once constituted) or an emergency arbitrator (in some institutions) may issue such orders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>✅ This means the tribunal can order these measures <strong>at any stage before the final award</strong> is issued.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before the final award</strong> (so, anytime during the arbitration).</li>
<li>Can be <strong>urgent</strong>—sometimes even requested <strong>before the tribunal is fully formed</strong> (through the courts or emergency arbitrator).</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="d-arbitrators-terms-of-appointment">D. Arbitrator’s Terms of Appointment</span></h3><p>Terms of Appointment are the <strong>written terms</strong> that explain the <strong>responsibilities, rights, and expectations</strong> of the arbitrator and the parties.</p>
<h4><span id="1-do-they-always-need-to-be-signed">1. Do They Always Need to Be Signed?</span></h4><p>May vary due to applicable law, terms of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>Generally unnecessary for institutional matters.</p>
<p>Whether these terms are needed <strong>depends on</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>law</strong> that applies to the arbitration;</li>
<li>The <strong>arbitration agreement</strong> between the parties;</li>
<li>Whether it is an <strong>institutional arbitration</strong> (e.g. under HKIAC).</li>
</ul>
<p>➡️ If it’s under institutions like <strong>HKIAC</strong>, <strong>Schedules 2 and 3</strong> of the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules already cover many of these issues, so parties may <strong>not need a separate appointment agreement</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="2-what-do-these-terms-usually-include">2. What Do These Terms Usually Include?</span></h4><h5><span id="1️⃣-basic-details-of-the-dispute-amp-procedural-rules">1️⃣ <strong>Basic details of the dispute &amp; procedural rules</strong></span></h5><ul>
<li>What the dispute is about (just a short description).</li>
<li>What procedural rules apply (if not already agreed in the arbitration clause).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: “This is a dispute over a commercial lease contract. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules will apply.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><span id="2️⃣-remuneration-deposits-expenses-cancellation">2️⃣ <strong>Remuneration, deposits, expenses, cancellation</strong></span></h5><ul>
<li><strong>Remuneration</strong> &#x3D; How much the arbitrator gets paid.</li>
<li><strong>Deposits</strong> &#x3D; Advance payments by the parties to cover expected costs.</li>
<li><strong>Expenses</strong> &#x3D; Things like travel, hotel, or courier fees.</li>
<li><strong>Cancellation</strong> &#x3D; What happens if arbitration is cancelled—who pays for what.</li>
</ul>
<p>🧾 <strong>Joint and several liability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Means each party is <strong>individually and collectively responsible</strong> for the arbitrator’s fees.</li>
<li>If one party doesn’t pay, the other may have to cover it.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="3️⃣-conflicts-of-interest">3️⃣ <strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></span></h5><ul>
<li>The arbitrator must <strong>disclose anything</strong> that might make them look biased.</li>
<li>Parties must trust that the arbitrator is <strong>independent and impartial</strong>.</li>
<li>Immunity from suit: The arbitrator is usually <strong>protected from being sued</strong> for anything they do while acting in their role—unless there’s bad faith or dishonesty.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="4️⃣-governing-law-and-dispute-resolution-clause">4️⃣ Governing law and dispute resolution clause</span></h5><ul>
<li>What law governs the arbitrator’s appointment agreement (e.g. Hong Kong law).</li>
<li>How disputes about the appointment itself will be resolved (e.g. court or arbitration).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-fee-structure">3. Fee Structure</span></h4><p><strong>HKIAC</strong>: Offers both hourly rates (<strong>Schedule 2</strong>) and ad valorem rates (<strong>Schedule 3</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>ICC</strong>: Typically uses a scale based on the amount in dispute.</p>
<h3><span id="e-mode-of-service">E. Mode of Service</span></h3><p>“Mode of Service” refers to <strong>how</strong> legal documents (like claims, responses, evidence, etc.) are delivered between the parties and the tribunal during arbitration. This is important to ensure that <strong>everyone receives documents on time</strong> and can respond appropriately.</p>
<p>Setting the “mode of service” means deciding how documents will be exchanged during arbitration—whether it’s through emails, secure portals, or even physical copies. Clear contact details and labelling systems help keep everything organized and ensure no party misses important information.</p>
<h4><span id="1-document-delivery-methods">1. Document Delivery Methods</span></h4><p>How documents will be served can be agreed upon at the start of the arbitration. Common methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Fast, easy, and often the default method for communication.</li>
<li><strong>Document Portal</strong>: A secure, online place where parties can upload and access documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s essential that all parties agree on the method(s) for document delivery to avoid delays or misunderstandings.</p>
<h4><span id="2-submission-format">2. Submission Format</span></h4><p>When it comes to how documents should be submitted, there are two main options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard Copies</strong>: Traditional physical copies of documents.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic-only Filings</strong>: More common nowadays, especially in <strong>institutional arbitrations</strong>, where all documents are submitted <strong>electronically</strong> (via email or a portal).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-contact-details-amp-communication-methods">3. Contact Details &amp; Communication Methods</span></h4><p>It’s important to specify the contact details of the parties and their lawyers, so communication is clear and direct. Key things to include are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-participating parties</strong>: Even if a party isn’t actively participating in the arbitration, they should still receive notices and updates.</li>
<li><strong>Updating contact details</strong>: There should be a <strong>clear process</strong> for notifying other parties and the tribunal if contact details change.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-methods-of-service-for-submissions">4. Methods of Service for Submissions</span></h4><p>Common methods for sending documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure File Transfer Sites</strong>: Specialized, secure websites for transferring large documents.</li>
<li><strong>USB or Hard Copy</strong>: Sometimes parties still use physical media to exchange documents, especially for sensitive or large files.</li>
<li><strong>Case Management Platforms</strong>: Platforms like the <strong>HKIAC Case Management System</strong> or others that allow all documents to be submitted and tracked in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="5-document-labelling">5. Document Labelling</span></h4><p>Documents must be <strong>properly labelled</strong> to keep everything organized. Labels help identify what each document is and where it fits in the case. Common labels include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correspondence</strong>: Letters or communications between parties.</li>
<li><strong>Exhibits</strong>: Evidence presented during the arbitration.</li>
<li><strong>Statements</strong>: Parties’ written arguments or witness statements.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="f-arbitral-rules">F. Arbitral Rules</span></h3><p>The arbitration procedure is often outlined directly in the arbitration agreement. If not agreed at the start, it might be useful to agree to a set of rules or a framework to ensure clarity on how the arbitration will proceed.</p>
<p>Administered Arbitration offers structure, clear rules, and support in managing finances and procedures, but it comes with institutional fees.</p>
<p>Ad Hoc Arbitration gives more flexibility and potential savings, but it also requires the parties to handle everything themselves.</p>
<h4><span id="1-types-of-arbitration-procedures">1. Types of Arbitration Procedures</span></h4><ul>
<li><p><strong>Administered Institutional Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>This type of arbitration is handled by a <strong>designated institution</strong> (like <strong>HKIAC</strong>, <strong>ICC</strong>, <strong>LCIA</strong>, etc.).</p>
<p>The institution has a <strong>set of detailed rules</strong> that govern the procedure and the <strong>management of the case</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ad Hoc Arbitration</strong> (e.g., <strong>UNCITRAL</strong> Rules)</p>
<p>This means arbitration is <strong>managed by the parties themselves</strong> without an institution’s involvement.</p>
<p>The parties can agree on the procedural rules (like the <strong>UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules</strong>) or develop their own set of rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-benefits-of-administered-institutional-arbitration">2. Benefits of Administered (Institutional) Arbitration</span></h4><ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Rules for Proceeding</strong></p>
<p>Institutions like <strong>HKIAC</strong> provide <strong>clear, pre-established rules</strong> that govern every step of the process. This can be useful to avoid disputes over procedure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Administration of Financial Aspects</strong></p>
<p>The institution takes care of <strong>deposits, payments, and other financial matters</strong>, ensuring things run smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Procedures</strong>: If there are any issues with the appointment of an arbitrator or disputes on procedures, the institution often has mechanisms in place to address them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scrutiny of Decisions&#x2F;Orders&#x2F;Awards</strong></p>
<p>Many institutions have a <strong>scrutiny process</strong> to ensure the quality and fairness of the decisions, orders, and awards made by the arbitrators (though the level of scrutiny varies depending on the institution).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-benefits-of-ad-hoc-arbitration">3. Benefits of Ad Hoc Arbitration</span></h4><ul>
<li><p><strong>Full Flexibility to Agree on the Procedure</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>ad hoc arbitration</strong>, the parties have the <strong>freedom</strong> to <strong>design their own rules</strong> and set the procedures as they wish, without being tied to an institution’s set rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cost Savings</strong> (Questionable)</p>
<p>In theory, ad hoc arbitration can be <strong>cheaper</strong> because there are no <strong>administrative fees</strong> charged by institutions.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>lack of structure</strong> and the need for parties to manage everything themselves could lead to <strong>higher costs</strong> in terms of time and effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="g-written-submissions">G. Written Submissions</span></h3><p>The tribunal decides the <strong>form</strong> (Memorial-style vs. Pleadings-style) and <strong>timeline</strong> for written submissions to ensure the arbitration process is efficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear <strong>deadlines</strong> are essential to avoid delays.</li>
<li>Practical issues include whether submissions are <strong>electronic or paper</strong>, and <strong>specific formatting rules</strong>.</li>
<li>Environmental concerns, like the <strong>Green Pledge</strong>, are becoming important in ensuring arbitrations are <strong>more sustainable</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="1-forms-of-written-submissions">1. Forms of Written Submissions</span></h4><p>The tribunal needs to decide what type of <strong>written submissions</strong> are required from the parties, and this usually falls into two styles:</p>
<h5><span id="1️⃣-memorial-style">1️⃣ Memorial-style</span></h5><p>This is a <strong>detailed statement</strong> of the case that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All evidence and arguments</strong> (fact and law).</li>
<li><strong>Supporting documents</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Witness statements</strong> and <strong>expert reports</strong> that will be relied upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>A “Memorial” is like a <strong>comprehensive book</strong> of everything the party wants to present in their case.</p>
<h5><span id="2️⃣-pleadings-style">2️⃣ Pleadings-style</span></h5><p>A more <strong>brief and focused statement</strong>, which typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential facts</strong> for the claim or defence.</li>
<li>Later, <strong>documentary evidence</strong> will be exchanged, as well as <strong>witness statements</strong> and <strong>expert reports</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A “Pleading” is like a <strong>short summary</strong> that presents the core facts, and then parties can submit more details over time.</p>
<h4><span id="2-firm-deadlines-for-written-submissions">2. Firm Deadlines for Written Submissions</span></h4><p>A detailed <strong>schedule</strong> is set, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number and timing of submissions.</li>
<li>Length and structure of written pleadings.</li>
<li>Timelines for disclosure&#x2F;discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosure Practices</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common law systems often allow broader document discovery.</li>
<li>Civil law systems are typically more limited.</li>
<li>The tribunal must balance these differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the <strong>preliminary hearing</strong>, the tribunal should <strong>set clear deadlines</strong> for the submission of written materials to avoid <strong>delays and uncertainty</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is important</strong>: Clear deadlines help <strong>keep the process moving</strong> smoothly and ensure that all parties have enough time to prepare their submissions. It also prevents one side from dragging out the process unnecessarily.</p>
<h4><span id="3-practical-considerations-for-submissions">3. Practical Considerations for Submissions</span></h4><h5><span id="1-electronic-or-paper-submissions">(1) Electronic or Paper Submissions?</span></h5><p>Will submissions be made <strong>electronically</strong>, via email or a case management platform?</p>
<p>Or will <strong>physical copies</strong> be required (e.g., printed and delivered)?</p>
<p>Many arbitrations now <strong>favor electronic submissions</strong> for efficiency, but some cases still require <strong>hard copies</strong>.</p>
<h5><span id="2-formatting-requirements">(2) Formatting Requirements</span></h5><p>The tribunal may set <strong>specific rules</strong> on formatting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Font size</strong>, <strong>font type</strong>, <strong>page count</strong>, <strong>paper size</strong>, and <strong>paragraph numbering</strong> may all be regulated.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules ensure that all submissions are <strong>consistent and easy to read</strong>. It also helps the tribunal quickly find important sections in the documents.</p>
<h5><span id="3-green-pledge-and-greener-arbitrations">(3) Green Pledge and Greener Arbitrations</span></h5><p>There is an increasing movement in arbitration towards being more <strong>environmentally friendly</strong>. This includes initiatives like the <strong>Green Pledge</strong>, which encourages parties to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize paper usage.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary printing.</li>
<li>Use <strong>electronic submissions</strong> whenever possible to reduce the environmental impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="h-document-discovery">H. Document Discovery</span></h3><p><strong>Arbitration</strong> is one area where <strong>civil law</strong> and <strong>common law</strong> approaches have a unique blend.</p>
<ul>
<li>In civil law countries, the judge often plays a <strong>central role in gathering evidence</strong>.</li>
<li>In common law, the <strong>parties themselves</strong> typically take the lead in evidence gathering through <strong>discovery</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>In arbitration</strong>, there’s a mix of both systems: parties may have to gather evidence, but the tribunal often has a role in overseeing the process to ensure fairness and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gold standard: IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (Art 3)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The International Bar Association (IBA) Rules are considered the gold standard for how evidence should be handled in international arbitration.</li>
<li>Article 3 of the IBA Rules sets out general guidelines for evidence-taking, which include principles like:<ul>
<li>Fairness, due process, and equal treatment of the parties.</li>
<li>The process should be transparent, allowing both sides to present their case and evidence in an orderly and fair manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anticipated process and reality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discovery requests using Redfern Schedules</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong> refers to the process of requesting and producing evidence in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Redfern Schedules</strong> are a widely used tool to structure <strong>discovery requests</strong>. They are detailed forms that help parties request documents in a <strong>clear and organized way</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The schedule includes:<ul>
<li><strong>What document</strong> is being requested.</li>
<li><strong>Why</strong> it’s necessary for the case.</li>
<li>The <strong>relevant time period</strong> or context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Timetable for submission, response, reply, determination by Tribunal</p>
<p>A <strong>timetable</strong> is established for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submission of discovery requests</strong> by the requesting party.</li>
<li><strong>Responses to requests</strong>: The other party must provide or object to the documents.</li>
<li><strong>Replies and determinations</strong> by the tribunal: The tribunal will review any disputes and may issue orders regarding the requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Review, reformulating requests, redaction, partial production, half-hearted compliance and adverse inferences</p>
<p>After the initial discovery requests, parties may <strong>review</strong> the documents received and may need to <strong>reformulate their requests</strong> if the evidence isn’t sufficient or relevant. This could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redaction</strong> (removing sensitive information from documents).</li>
<li><strong>Partial production</strong> (producing only parts of the requested documents).</li>
<li><strong>Half-hearted compliance</strong> (where parties don’t fully comply with discovery orders).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a party <strong>fails to comply</strong> with discovery requests, the tribunal may draw <strong>adverse inferences</strong>, meaning they may assume that the withheld evidence would have been harmful to the party’s case.</p>
<p><em>e.g. If a party refuses to hand over an important document, the tribunal might assume that document <strong>would not support</strong> their case.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong> in international arbitration is where civil and common law approaches meet, and it follows guidelines like the <strong>IBA Rules on Evidence</strong>. The process usually involves using <strong>Redfern Schedules</strong> for document requests, and the tribunal sets a <strong>clear timetable</strong> for submissions and responses. There may be issues such as <strong>redactions, partial production</strong>, or <strong>half-hearted compliance</strong>. If a party fails to fully comply, the tribunal might make <strong>adverse inferences</strong>.</p>
<h3><span id="i-witness-evidence">I. Witness Evidence</span></h3><h4><span id="1-po1-and-mandatory-content-for-statements">1. PO1 and Mandatory Content for Statements</span></h4><p>A <strong>Procedural Order (PO1)</strong> is typically issued by the tribunal at the start of the arbitration to set the rules and deadlines for the procedure. One of the things it often covers is the <strong>content</strong> required for witness statements. These statements must contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identity, role, relationship to party and dispute</p>
<p>The statement must clearly identify the <strong>witness</strong> (e.g., name, occupation), their <strong>role</strong> in the case, and their <strong>relationship</strong> to the parties involved in the dispute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description of education and qualifications</p>
<p>The witness needs to provide a brief <strong>background</strong> of their <strong>education</strong> and <strong>qualifications</strong>, particularly if they are an expert witness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Affirmation of truth of the statement</p>
<p>The witness must affirm that their statement is true to the best of their knowledge and belief.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Statements of fact and basis for knowledge belief </p>
<p>The witness should clearly state <strong>what facts they know</strong>, how they know them, and the basis of their <strong>knowledge or belief</strong>. This ensures that the tribunal understands where the information is coming from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Supporting documentary evidence</p>
<p>Any documentary evidence that supports the witness’s statement must be included to provide context or proof of their claims.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-timing-of-statements">2. Timing of statements</span></h4><p>The timing for submitting witness statements depends on the style of submissions agreed upon by the parties and the tribunal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Memorial Style (together with pleadings)</p>
<p>In this approach, the <strong>witness statements</strong> are submitted <strong>alongside</strong> the <strong>pleadings</strong>. This means that both the <strong>legal arguments</strong> (pleadings) and <strong>witness statements</strong> are presented at the same time.</p>

<li><p>Pleadings Style (after pleadings discovery but before experts) </p>
<p>In this approach, <strong>witness statements</strong> are submitted <strong>after</strong> the <strong>pleadings</strong> and <strong>discovery</strong> phases but <strong>before</strong> the <strong>expert reports</strong> are filed. This allows the parties to exchange evidence and arguments before involving experts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-key-questions-for-witness-statements">3. Key Questions for Witness Statements</span></h4><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">To stand as evidence in chief? </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In some cases, the <strong>witness statement</strong> can <strong>stand as the evidence-in-chief</strong>, meaning that the witness doesn’t have to repeat everything in person. The statement itself can be considered as their primary evidence.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">To be available for cross-examination?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>After the witness statement is presented, the witness may be available for <strong>cross-examination</strong> by the opposing party. This allows the other party to challenge the witness’s testimony.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">To be in the hearing room before giving evidence? </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Often, the tribunal will decide whether <strong>witnesses can be present in the hearing room</strong> before they give evidence. In some cases, the witness may be excluded from the hearing room to prevent influencing other witnesses.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Costs of witness? </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <strong>costs</strong> associated with having a witness testify, including any <strong>fees</strong> or <strong>expenses</strong>, may be addressed. The parties should clarify who is responsible for the costs of witnesses, whether they are expert witnesses or factual witnesses.</p>
<p>In simpler cases (e.g., pure debt claims), parties may agree to dispense with hearings or witnesses altogether.</p>
<h3><span id="j-expert-evidence">J. Expert Evidence</span></h3><ul>
<li>It’s crucial to appoint <strong>experts</strong> based on their <strong>discipline</strong> and the <strong>issues</strong> at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Party-appointed</strong> experts are controlled by the party but may be seen as biased, while <strong>tribunal-appointed</strong> experts are neutral but offer less control to the parties.</li>
<li>Experts are required to provide a <strong>statement of instructions</strong> and <strong>statement of independence</strong> to ensure <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>neutrality</strong>.</li>
<li>Experts should meet and produce <strong>joint statements</strong> to resolve differences before the hearing.</li>
<li>The <strong>CIArb Protocol</strong> provides best practices for using expert witnesses, promoting <strong>transparency</strong> and <strong>independence</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="1-identifying-expert-disciplines-and-issues">1. Identifying Expert Disciplines and Issues</span></h4><p>When experts are involved in an arbitration, it’s essential to ensure that <strong>evidence is given in the right disciplines</strong> for the <strong>right issues</strong>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the dispute involves <strong>construction</strong>, an <strong>engineering expert</strong> might be needed.</li>
<li>If the issue is related to <strong>finance</strong>, a <strong>financial expert</strong> or <strong>accountant</strong> might be appointed.</li>
</ul>
<p>By ensuring that experts are appointed for the <strong>specific issue</strong> at hand, the tribunal can better assess the <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>credibility</strong> of their testimony.</p>
<h4><span id="2-party-appointed-vs-tribunal-appointed-experts">2. Party-Appointed vs. Tribunal-Appointed Experts</span></h4><p>There are two main categories of expert witnesses:</p>
<h5><span id="1️⃣-party-appointed-experts">1️⃣ Party-Appointed Experts</span></h5><p>These experts are <strong>appointed by one of the parties</strong> to the arbitration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: The party has more control over the expert’s <strong>instructions</strong> and <strong>selection</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: There may be concerns about <strong>bias</strong>, as the expert is hired by one side.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="2️⃣-tribunal-appointed-experts">2️⃣ Tribunal-Appointed Experts</span></h5><p>These experts are <strong>appointed by the tribunal</strong> itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pros</strong>: The tribunal can appoint an <strong>independent expert</strong> to ensure fairness and neutrality, particularly in cases where both parties disagree on the expert’s findings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cons</strong>: The parties may have less control over the expert’s <strong>selection</strong> and the <strong>instructions</strong> they receive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-requirements-for-expert-witnesses">3. Requirements for Expert Witnesses</span></h4><p>To ensure that expert testimony is <strong>fair</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong>, certain requirements must be met:</p>
<h4><span id="1-statement-of-instructions">(1) Statement of Instructions</span></h4><p>The expert must provide a <strong>statement of instructions</strong> that explains what they have been asked to do, and the specific issues they are addressing. This helps ensure <strong>transparency</strong> in the process.</p>
<h4><span id="2-statement-of-independence">(2) Statement of Independence</span></h4><p>Experts must also provide a <strong>statement of independence</strong>, confirming that they are <strong>neutral</strong> and not influenced by the party that appointed them. This statement ensures the <strong>objectivity</strong> of the expert’s testimony.</p>
<h5><span id="3-expert-meetings-and-joint-statements">(3) Expert Meetings and Joint Statements</span></h5><ul>
<li>Experts are often encouraged (or required) to meet <strong>before the hearing</strong> to discuss their <strong>differences</strong> and <strong>agree on areas of common ground</strong>.</li>
<li>After these meetings, experts may be required to produce a <strong>joint statement</strong>, which summarizes their agreed-upon conclusions and highlights the areas of <strong>disagreement</strong>. This helps streamline the process and makes it easier for the tribunal to assess the experts’ testimony.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-chartered-institute-of-arbitrators-protocol">4. Chartered Institute of Arbitrators Protocol</span></h4><p>The <strong>Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb)</strong> has developed the <strong>Protocol for the Use of Party-Appointed Expert Witnesses</strong> in International Arbitration.</p>
<p>This protocol sets out best practices for using expert witnesses, ensuring that they are used effectively and ethically in arbitration proceedings. It encourages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear instructions</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong> in the expert’s role.</li>
<li>Emphasis on the <strong>independence</strong> of the expert.</li>
<li>The use of <strong>joint meetings</strong> and <strong>joint statements</strong> to help resolve areas of disagreement before the hearing.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id></span></h3><h3><span id="k-the-hearing">K. The Hearing</span></h3><ul>
<li><strong>Document-only arbitration</strong> may be possible, but hearings are required when <strong>witnesses need to be examined</strong> or parties request <strong>oral submissions</strong>.</li>
<li>The decision to hold a <strong>hearing</strong> (physical or virtual) should be made early, with <strong>clear timelines</strong> for scheduling and addressing logistical issues.</li>
<li>A <strong>chess clock</strong> can be used to allocate time during the hearing, ensuring both parties have equal opportunities to present their case.</li>
<li>Pre-hearing and post-hearing submissions help streamline the process.</li>
<li>The concept of <strong>bifurcation</strong>—separating liability and quantum—can save time and costs, but in practice, it may not always be efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="1-arbitrations-decided-on-documents-alone">1. Arbitrations Decided on Documents Alone</span></h4><p>Some <strong>arbitrations</strong> can be decided entirely based on <strong>documents</strong>, without the need for a hearing. This is often referred to as a <strong>documents-only arbitration</strong>, where the tribunal reviews the written submissions, evidence, and witness statements to make a decision.</p>
<p>However, a <strong>hearing</strong> may be necessary in certain cases, such as when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disputed facts</strong> require witness testimony.</li>
<li><strong>Parties demand</strong> oral submissions to present their case in person.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-when-is-a-hearing-necessary">2. When is a Hearing Necessary?</span></h4><p>A decision on whether an <strong>evidential hearing</strong> is required should be made <strong>early in the process</strong> to avoid delays and uncertainty.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Is an evidential hearing required?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If the facts are disputed and the parties need to <strong>examine witnesses</strong>, a hearing may be necessary.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Physical or Virtual?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in <strong>virtual hearings</strong>, especially for international arbitrations where the parties and tribunal are spread across different locations. The decision between <strong>physical</strong> or <strong>virtual</strong> hearings will depend on factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complexity of the case.</li>
<li>The convenience for the parties and tribunal.</li>
<li>The need for direct witness examination.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-timetable-for-hearing">3. Timetable for Hearing</span></h4><p>The <strong>timing</strong> and <strong>logistics</strong> of the hearing are crucial for an efficient process. Some key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fixing hearing dates</strong> as early as possible, along with the <strong>venue</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Addressing practical issues like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transcription</strong>: Who will transcribe the hearing (e.g., stenographer)?</li>
<li><strong>Translation</strong>: If required, which documents or witness statements need translation?</li>
<li><strong>Hearing bundles</strong>: Preparing and organizing all documents and evidence for the hearing.</li>
<li><strong>Room bookings</strong>: Ensuring the hearing venue is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A <strong>chess clock</strong> method might be used to allocate time during the hearing. This is a technique where each party is given a set amount of time to present their case, and the time is tracked. The goal is to ensure that both parties have equal time and that the hearing runs efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The use of a chess clock helps keep the hearing focused and avoids unnecessary delays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-pre-hearing-and-post-hearing-submissions">4. Pre-Hearing and Post-Hearing Submissions</span></h4><p>Pre-hearing and post-hearing submissions are common:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pre-hearing</strong>: Parties may submit additional materials, like evidence or a summary of their arguments, in preparation for the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Post-hearing</strong>: After the hearing, parties may submit a final <strong>post-hearing brief</strong> or additional documents to address issues raised during the hearing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="5-bifurcation-separating-liability-and-quantum">5. Bifurcation: Separating Liability and Quantum</span></h4><p><strong>Bifurcation</strong> in arbitration refers to <strong>dividing the proceedings</strong> into <strong>two or more phases</strong>. This approach is used when the tribunal decides that certain issues should be addressed separately, rather than all at once. The tribunal may handle specific matters first, with the results of these phases potentially impacting the rest of the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bifurcation</strong> divides arbitration into <strong>phases</strong>, typically addressing <strong>jurisdiction</strong>, <strong>liability</strong>, and <strong>quantum</strong> separately.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong> include potential savings in <strong>time</strong> and <strong>costs</strong>, especially if the early findings resolve the dispute.</li>
<li><strong>Drawbacks</strong> include delays in the <strong>substantive hearing</strong> and potential <strong>disadvantages for claimants</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Respondents</strong> often favor bifurcation, while <strong>claimants</strong> may find it disadvantageous due to delays in addressing the main issues.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="1-should-liability-and-quantum-be-dealt-with-separately">(1) Should Liability and Quantum Be Dealt with Separately?</span></h5><p>In technical disputes, especially in areas like <strong>energy</strong> or <strong>infrastructure</strong>, issues of <strong>liability</strong> (responsibility for the defect) and <strong>quantum</strong> (the value of the loss or damage caused by the defect) are often complex and separate. Here’s how this can be handled:</p>
<p>In theory, if the <strong>Respondent</strong> (defendant) <strong>wins on liability</strong>, the costs associated with <strong>quantum evidence</strong> are wasted because there’s no need to address the amount of damages.</p>
<p>As a result, splitting the case into two phases—<strong>liability first</strong>, then <strong>quantum</strong>—can save <strong>time</strong> and <strong>costs</strong>. This is called <strong>bifurcation</strong>.</p>
<p>However, in practice, the <strong>availability of the parties</strong> and the <strong>tribunal</strong>, as well as the time required to reach a decision on liability, may outweigh the potential cost savings from bifurcating the case.</p>
<p>For example, splitting the case might take longer than dealing with both issues at once, especially if the parties or tribunal have limited time for hearings.</p>
<h5><span id="2-typical-uses-of-bifurcation">(2) Typical Uses of Bifurcation</span></h5><p><strong>Jurisdiction and Merits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>First phase</strong>: Determine whether the tribunal has <strong>jurisdiction</strong> to hear the case.</p>
<p>If the tribunal rules that it lacks jurisdiction, the case ends there, and no further proceedings are needed. This can save both time and costs if the jurisdictional challenge is successful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Liability and Quantum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Second phase</strong>: Address the <strong>liability</strong> issue before proceeding to <strong>quantum</strong> (the value of damages).</p>
<p>In a case involving complex issues of <strong>liability</strong> (e.g., fault or responsibility for an incident), separating this issue from the <strong>quantum</strong> phase may streamline proceedings. If the tribunal finds that there is no liability, there’s no need to address the amount of damages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="3-advantages-of-bifurcation">(3) Advantages of Bifurcation</span></h5><p><strong>Saves Time and Costs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: If the findings in one phase (e.g., jurisdiction or liability) resolve the entire dispute, bifurcation can save considerable <strong>time</strong> and <strong>costs</strong> by avoiding unnecessary proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encouraged by Legal Frameworks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Efficiency in arbitration is encouraged by laws and rules, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 46 of the Arbitration Ordinance</strong> (Hong Kong)</li>
<li><strong>Article 13 of the HKIAC Rules</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These provisions push tribunals to manage the arbitration process efficiently, which can include bifurcation if it leads to a faster resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="4-drawbacks-of-bifurcation">(4) Drawbacks of Bifurcation</span></h5><p><strong>Delay in Substantive Hearing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bifurcation can <strong>delay</strong> the <strong>substantive hearing</strong> because the tribunal first resolves issues like <strong>jurisdiction</strong> or <strong>liability</strong> before addressing the full merits of the case.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-trial phase</strong>: The bifurcation process can lead to an additional “mini-trial” phase, during which time and resources are spent on issues that might not be relevant if the tribunal decides against jurisdiction or liability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Claimant Disadvantage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the tribunal decides to bifurcate the case, <strong>claimants</strong> may suffer delays. This can be particularly disadvantageous if the <strong>substantive claims</strong> (e.g., damages) cannot progress while the tribunal deals with preliminary issues.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="5-who-benefits-from-bifurcation">(5) Who Benefits from Bifurcation?</span></h5><p><strong>Respondents</strong> (defendants) often favor bifurcation, especially if they are challenging the tribunal’s <strong>jurisdiction</strong> or want to delay discussions on liability and damages. If jurisdiction is not established, they avoid addressing the merits of the claim entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Claimants</strong>, on the other hand, may not benefit as much from bifurcation. While bifurcation could result in a quicker decision on jurisdiction or liability, it could also delay the progress of their substantive claims and prolong the dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>A survey of <strong>parties and counsel</strong> reveals varying levels of willingness to <strong>forego certain procedural steps</strong> in order to reduce costs and streamline the process. For example, many parties and legal teams are opting for more <strong>concise submissions</strong>, aiming to <strong>limit page counts</strong> and avoid excessive documentation. This approach is not just about reducing length but also about <strong>being creative with formatting</strong>, such as expanding margins or adjusting font sizes, to condense information.</p>
<h2><span id="iii-practical-issues">III. Practical Issues</span></h2><h3><span id="a-the-role-of-memorials-and-the-issue-of-length">A. The Role of Memorials and the Issue of Length</span></h3><p>Memorials are a key part of the arbitration process, where both sides submit their detailed arguments. However, the <strong>length of memorials</strong> can become problematic. One example shared was a case where the <strong>first round memorial</strong> was around 150 pages, and the <strong>third round</strong> stretched to 400 pages per side. This increase in volume, while not always necessary, is often the result of legal teams’ efforts to cover all potential points, even those that may seem less relevant to the tribunal.</p>
<p>Long memorials are challenging for <strong>associates and younger lawyers</strong>, who are tasked with <strong>reading, analyzing, and summarizing</strong> voluminous documents. Often, <strong>important information</strong> gets lost in the sheer volume of material.</p>
<p>From a lawyer’s perspective, there is often pressure to address every potential issue, as clients may want to ensure all possible angles are covered. However, it is crucial to recognize that <strong>tribunals</strong> typically prefer <strong>short, succinct submissions</strong> that get to the point. Tribunals are not interested in reading long, repetitive arguments that don’t advance the case significantly.</p>
<p>The key is to <strong>balance thoroughness with brevity</strong>, addressing only the most crucial issues that will influence the outcome of the arbitration. As one example, a <strong>former firm policy</strong> emphasized the importance of <strong>brevity and clarity</strong>: if a tribunal cannot read your <strong>witness statements</strong> and <strong>memorials</strong> within the time allotted (including travel time between hearings), the submission is too lengthy.</p>
<p>Typically, submissions should range around <strong>100 pages or less</strong>, although larger cases with multiple complex issues may result in longer documents. Submissions exceeding <strong>100 pages</strong> are generally seen as excessive, and tribunals may question their relevance.</p>
<p>However, there are instances where a <strong>client’s input</strong> may demand longer submissions, even if the case could be addressed more concisely. One example involved a <strong>straightforward case</strong> that could have been resolved with a <strong>brief 6-page submission</strong>, but the client’s nervousness led them to demand additional arguments, resulting in a much longer document.</p>
<h3><span id="b-technological-challenges-and-human-limitations">B. Technological Challenges and Human Limitations</span></h3><p>Arbitrators, lawyers, and clients often face <strong>technological and logistical challenges</strong> in today’s arbitration process. For instance, early cases were conducted with less reliable technology, such as <strong>poor Wi-Fi</strong>, which sometimes led to delays or issues with delivering submissions. Today, <strong>virtual hearings</strong> are common, which, although convenient, come with their own set of challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are <strong>human limitations</strong> to consider when reading extensive memorials. A lawyer shared an experience where they had to read a <strong>15-page submission</strong> and then face the challenge of remembering details as they moved through the document. In cases with <strong>hundreds of pages</strong>, it becomes difficult for anyone, regardless of experience, to process all the information without forgetting key points, especially if the document is not properly organized.</p>
<h3><span id="c-client-expectations-and-managing-submissions">C. Client Expectations and Managing Submissions</span></h3><p>Managing client expectations is also a significant part of the process. In some cases, clients may want to include <strong>all potential arguments</strong> in the submission, even if they are <strong>less relevant</strong> to the case. This can be due to the client’s <strong>inexperience</strong> in arbitration or their desire to be thorough, but it often leads to unnecessarily long documents.</p>
<p>During <strong>reply rounds</strong>, the situation can become even more complex. While the <strong>initial submission</strong> might address the core issues, <strong>reply submissions</strong> can end up reiterating points already made. As a result, tribunals are left to sift through the same arguments over and over without gaining new insights.</p>
<h3><span id="d-jurisdictional-challenges-timing-and-strategy">D. Jurisdictional Challenges: Timing and Strategy</span></h3><p>Jurisdictional challenges are often raised at the <strong>start of the arbitration</strong> to avoid unnecessary proceedings. However, raising a <strong>jurisdictional challenge late in the process</strong> can complicate matters. While some tribunals might not entertain objections raised after a certain point, <strong>tribunal flexibility</strong> exists, especially if a party was not fully involved or did not participate in earlier stages.</p>
<p>In some rare instances, tribunals may still consider <strong>late jurisdictional challenges</strong> to ensure that the <strong>fairness of the process</strong> is upheld, particularly when there is a concern that <strong>procedural issues</strong> could lead to the award being set aside at a later stage. The <strong>jurisdictional challenge</strong> in this case was predicated on the necessity of reviewing the <strong>claimant’s statement of claim</strong> before formulating a solid challenge. The claimant’s page was not yet available, so the respondent requested additional time to assess the statement of claim. The opposing party did not object to this approach. As a result, the timeline was structured to allow the respondent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the statement of claim after it was submitted.</li>
<li>Take several weeks to decide whether to proceed with a <strong>jurisdictional challenge</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach was a strategic decision to ensure the respondent had ample time to properly analyze the claimant’s position before deciding on further legal actions. The extra time also allowed the respondent to <strong>adjust the timeline</strong> if necessary, without unduly delaying the proceedings. The situation was less extreme than the example of Eric’s scenario, but it demonstrates how respondents sometimes need time to assess claims before moving forward.</p>
<h3><span id="e-last-minute-participation">E. Last-Minute Participation</span></h3><p>In one particular case, the responding party had initially refrained from participating. However, two days before the <strong>jurisdictional hearing</strong>, the respondent engaged legal counsel. This last-minute involvement raised concerns, as the full case had already been framed and the timetable had been established. The <strong>institutional pressures</strong> to keep the arbitration on track and avoid delays were evident, as both the claimant and the institution were keen to proceed without further disruptions.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for parties to engage in <strong>strategic delay tactics</strong> to gain an advantage. These tactics, such as delaying participation or objecting to procedural issues, are often used to undermine the arbitration process or to gain a strategic edge. These challenges are part of the procedural landscape and can result in <strong>increased complexity</strong> in managing the arbitration timeline.</p>

<h1><span id="class-6-challenges-to-awards-and-public-policy-considerations">Class 6 - Challenges to Awards and Public Policy Considerations</span></h1><h2><span id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</span></h2><h3><span id="a-overview">A. Overview</span></h3><p>Imagine you have spent years working on an international arbitration: constituting the tribunal, preparing submissions, attending hearings. Now, after all that effort, you hold a lengthy award — fifty to sixty pages or more — and it is <strong>not</strong> in your favor.</p>
<p>At this point, critical questions arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can you do if you believe the award is flawed?</li>
<li>Are there errors in the application of law?</li>
<li>Was the tribunal improperly constituted?</li>
<li>Were there procedural irregularities?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the challenge process is essential at this juncture.</p>
<p>This session focuses on the mechanisms available to <strong>challenge an arbitral award</strong>, with a specific emphasis on the <strong>public policy exception</strong>.<br> We will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How awards can be challenged based on public policy</li>
<li>How public policy is defined in Hong Kong law and international arbitration</li>
<li>Examples of how public policy has been applied in actual cases</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-distinguishing-challenges-from-appeals">B. Distinguishing Challenges from Appeals</span></h3><p><strong>Important:</strong> challenging an international arbitral award is <strong>not the same</strong> as appealing a court judgment.</p>
<p>For example, in Hong Kong, you cannot simply file an appeal because you believe the tribunal made an error of law.</p>
<p>This is due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>New York Convention</strong>, which governs international arbitration</li>
<li>Article V of the Convention, which limits the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement of an award</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, recourse against an arbitral award is highly restricted compared to domestic court appeals.</p>
<h2><span id="ii-public-policy-a-ground-to-annul-or-refuse-enforcement">II. Public Policy – A Ground to Annul or Refuse Enforcement</span></h2><h3><span id="a-ground-for-annulment">A. Ground for Annulment</span></h3><p>This lecture zeroes in on a particular ground for challenge: <strong>the public policy exception</strong>, found in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention</p>
<p>Under the New York Convention, courts may <strong>refuse recognition or enforcement</strong> of an arbitral award if doing so would violate the public policy of the enforcing country.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set aside</strong> proceedings (annulment) require a party’s application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Refusal of enforcement</strong> can be initiated <strong>by the court itself</strong>, even if no party requests it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Article 34(2)(b)(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 34(2)(b)(ii)</strong></p>
<p>An arbitral award may be set aside by the court… only if:<br>(b) the court finds that:<br>…<br>(ii) the award is in conflict with the public policy of this State.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the Model Law, an arbitral award <strong>may be set aside</strong> if it is <strong>in conflict with the public policy</strong> of the state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Section 81 of the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance</p>
<p>  Hong Kong has <strong>adopted the Model Law verbatim</strong> through Section 81 of its Arbitration Ordinance. Thus, Hong Kong courts apply the same language and standards as the Model Law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other national arbitration regimes</p>
<p>  The public policy ground is a recognized concept worldwide, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>PRC Arbitration Law (Section 58)</strong>: Courts may set aside awards violating public policy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>PRC Arbitration Law, Section 58</strong></p>
<p> 人民法院认定该裁决违背社会公共利益的，应当裁定撤销。（If People’s Court determines that the award is against public policy, such award shall be set aside.）</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>UK Arbitration Act (1996 and upcoming revision)</strong>: Both recognize public policy as a ground for refusing enforcement or setting aside an award.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While “public policy” seems like a simple phrase, its actual scope and application are <strong>far more complex</strong>. </p>
<h3><span id="b-catch-all-provision-but-narrowly-interpreted">B. Catch-All Provision — But Narrowly Interpreted</span></h3><p>Public policy often appears at the end of statutory lists of grounds for challenging awards. This positioning tempts parties to <strong>treat it as a catch-all argument</strong>, claiming any dissatisfaction as a “public policy” issue.</p>
<p>However, courts in pro-arbitration jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Singapore, and England, have <strong>firmly resisted</strong> such expansive interpretations. Instead, courts emphasize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public policy challenges are permitted <strong>only in highly exceptional circumstances</strong>.</li>
<li>Mere disagreement with the tribunal’s findings of fact or law <strong>is insufficient</strong>.</li>
<li>Public policy is <strong>not</strong> an avenue for substantive review of the merits of the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <strong>Public policy</strong> is often used as a <strong>very narrow exception</strong> where a court can interfere with an arbitration award (for example, to set it aside or refuse to enforce it). Most national courts have annulled international awards on the basis of public policy only in limited, exceptional circumstances. </p>
<p>In most jurisdictions, the public policy doctrine is not a basis for reviewing the substance of the arbitrators’ award in an annulment action, and has generally been invoked only in cases of clear violations of fundamental, mandatory legal rules, not in cases of judicial disagreement with a tribunal’s substantive decisions or procedural rulings.</p>
<p>👉 Courts <strong>do not</strong> use public policy as an excuse to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-evaluate the <strong>merits</strong> of the tribunal’s decision (whether the tribunal made the “right” or “wrong” decision).</li>
<li>Disagree with the tribunal’s <strong>legal interpretations</strong> or <strong>procedural rulings</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, <strong>public policy</strong> challenges are usually accepted only when:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a <strong>clear violation</strong> of <strong>fundamental, mandatory legal principles</strong>.</li>
<li>The breach is so serious that it shocks the conscience of the legal system.</li>
</ul>
<p>e.g. Under <strong>French law</strong>, the bar for public policy violation is <strong>very high</strong>: the violation must <strong>“manifestly affect an essential rule of law or a principle of fundamental importance.”</strong> In other words, the breach must be <strong>obvious</strong> and involve a <strong>core legal principle</strong> (like fundamental human rights, due process, or rules against corruption or fraud).</p>
<p><strong>Public policy</strong> is a <strong>shield</strong>, not a <strong>sword</strong> — courts use it to <strong>protect</strong> their fundamental values, not to re-argue cases. <strong>Annulments</strong> based on public policy are <strong>extremely rare</strong> in international arbitration. <strong>Most mistakes or disagreements</strong> with the tribunal’s reasoning <strong>are not enough</strong> to invoke public policy.</p>
<p>Successful invocation of public policy typically requires showing a <strong>fundamental defect</strong> in the arbitration, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serious procedural irregularities</li>
<li>Breach of basic notions of morality or justice</li>
<li>Violations of rules essential to the state’s legal order (e.g., anti-money laundering, anti-bribery laws)</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple mistakes by the tribunal — even if they involve errors of law — <strong>do not</strong> amount to public policy violations.</p>
<h3><span id="c-refuse-enforcement">C. Refuse Enforcement</span></h3><h4><span id="1-article-v-new-york-convention">1. Article V, New York Convention</span></h4><p>Under <strong>Article V</strong> of the <strong>New York Convention (1958)</strong>, courts can <strong>refuse to enforce</strong> an arbitral award in specific situations. These are <strong>exceptions</strong>, not the rule — enforcement is the default.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>each country</strong> decides what its <strong>own public policy</strong> is — this is called <strong>national public policy</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Article V</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that:<br>(a) The parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or<br>(b) The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or<br>(c) The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced; or<br>(d) The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or<br>(e) The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.</li>
<li>Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that:<br>(a) The subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country; or<br><u>(b) The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.</u></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, this provision states that recognition <strong>“may be refused”</strong>, giving rise to a discussion about <strong>judicial discretion</strong>, which varies between jurisdictions. </p>
<p>The use of “<strong>may</strong>” in Article V of the New York Convention has sparked debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Germany</strong>, courts interpret “may” as <strong>shall</strong> — they <strong>must</strong> refuse enforcement if public policy is violated.</li>
<li>In <strong>England</strong>, courts retain <strong>discretion</strong> — even with a violation, they <strong>may still enforce</strong> if justice so requires.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seemingly minor linguistic difference can have <strong>major consequences</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Example: Deutsche Telekom Case (Singapore, 2023)</strong></em></p>
<p>Although not a public policy case, this dispute illustrates how the <strong>interpretation of “may”</strong> has practical significance. The <strong>Singapore Court of Appeal</strong> had to determine whether it <strong>had discretion</strong> to enforce an award that had been refused enforcement by an English court.</p>
<p>It shows how fine-grained differences in <strong>treaty language</strong> can lead to real-world legal divergence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span id="2-general-principles">2. General Principles</span></h4><p>Paralleling the NY Convention, national arbitration legislation uniformly permits the non-recognition of awards because they violate public policy.</p>
<p>One of the most frequently invoked bases for refusing to recognise an award is the public policy exception.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>UNCITRAL Model Law</strong> (Article 36(1)(b)(ii)): Allows courts to set aside awards in conflict with public policy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enforcement may be refused if it would be <strong>contrary to the public policy</strong> of the enforcing state.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance (Section 89(3)(b))</strong>: For refusing enforcement (if award was made abroad)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Courts may refuse enforcement if doing so would be <strong>contrary to public policy</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, most legal systems <strong>align with the NY Convention</strong>, but they interpret “public policy” <strong>in their own way</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="3-nz-standards-amp-divergent-approaches-under-nyc">3. NZ Standards &amp; Divergent Approaches under NYC</span></h4><p>An award is contrary to the public policy of New Zealand if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or<br>(b) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred –<br>(i) during the arbitral proceedings; or<br>(ii) in connection with the making of the award.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Zealand’s arbitration law gives <strong>concrete examples</strong> of what counts as a public policy violation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The award was obtained through <strong>fraud or corruption</strong>, or</li>
<li>There was a <strong>breach of natural justice</strong>, either during the arbitration or in making the award.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is helpful because it shows <strong>how broad or narrow</strong> a country might interpret public policy.</p>
<h4><span id="4-key-principles-and-differences-between-countries">4. Key Principles and Differences Between Countries</span></h4><p>In arbitration, when a country is asked to enforce a foreign arbitral award, it has the <strong>right to refuse</strong> <em>only</em> in <strong>very limited situations</strong>. One of those is if enforcing the award would <strong>violate that country’s public policy</strong>.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>“national public policy.”</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Why is it considered “national”?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>text of Article V(2)(b)</strong> says enforcement can be refused if it’s <strong>contrary to the public policy “of that country”</strong>.</li>
<li>Courts are not applying <strong>international standards</strong>, but <strong>their own domestic legal values and principles</strong>. That’s why different countries may interpret public policy <strong>in different ways</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The court in the country where enforcement is being sought (the judicial enforcement forum) decides whether public policy has been breached. The idea is: each country has the sovereign right to protect its fundamental legal principles.</p>
<p><strong>1️⃣ Germany</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treats “may” as <strong>“shall”</strong> → If there’s a violation of public policy, <strong>enforcement must be refused</strong>.</li>
<li>This approach is <strong>strict</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>2️⃣ England</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treats “may” as <strong>discretionary</strong> → Even if public policy is affected, the court can <strong>still enforce</strong> the award if appropriate.</li>
<li>This approach is <strong>flexible and pragmatic</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3️⃣ France</strong></p>
<p>French arbitration law sets a <strong>very high bar</strong> for public policy violations. To succeed, the violation must be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Of such a nature as to affect in a manifest manner a central rule of law or a principle of fundamental importance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wording highlights the <strong>extraordinary nature</strong> of the exception — it is not enough to show mere legal error.</p>
<p><strong>4️⃣ New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand has gone further in <strong>defining public policy</strong>. Under the <strong>New Zealand Arbitration Act</strong>, an award may be set aside <strong>only if</strong> its making was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Induced or affected by <strong>fraud</strong> or <strong>corruption</strong></li>
<li>Involved a <strong>breach of natural justice</strong> (i.e., due process)</li>
<li>Violated public policy in connection with the proceedings or the making of the award</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <strong>precise formulation</strong> — moving away from ambiguity and toward clearly defined triggers.</p>
<h4><span id="5-pro-enforcement-bias-of-the-new-york-convention">5. Pro-Enforcement Bias of the New York Convention</span></h4><p>To properly interpret “public policy,” we must remember the <strong>overarching goal</strong> of the New York Convention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To promote the global enforcement of arbitral awards</strong> and provide international commercial parties with a reliable dispute resolution mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>It favors enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>exceptions</strong> (like public policy) are <strong>interpreted narrowly</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is different from the older <strong>1927 Geneva Convention</strong>, which had broader grounds to refuse enforcement, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…contrary to the public policy or the principles of the law of the country…</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the NY Convention implies a <strong>pro-enforcement bias</strong>, and courts should be cautious when applying exceptions like public policy, ensuring they do not <strong>undermine the Convention’s purpose</strong>.</p>
<h2><span id="ii-how-is-public-policy-defined">II. How is Public Policy Defined?</span></h2><h3><span id="a-open-discussion-how-should-it-be-defined">A. Open Discussion: How Should It Be Defined?</span></h3><p>💭 <em>Eric King posed a hypothetical:</em> <em>Suppose the Hong Kong government asked you to redefine public policy in more concrete terms. What would you suggest?</em></p>
<p>📚 <strong>Suggested definitions from students:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State-reserved matters</strong>: Issues only the state should decide (e.g., criminal law)</li>
<li><strong>Justice and morality</strong>: Fundamental conceptions of fairness</li>
<li><strong>Perversity test</strong>: Decisions so unreasonable that no rational arbitrator could have made them</li>

<li><strong>Contravention of mandatory rules</strong></li>
<li><strong>Matters affecting third parties</strong> (e.g., family law, competition law)</li>
<li><strong>International public policy</strong> violations</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above have been <strong>raised in real cases</strong>, showing that while “public policy” is elusive, it is not unlimited. Courts strive to balance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respect for party autonomy</strong> and arbitration</li>
<li><strong>Protection of core legal values</strong> and public interest</li>
</ul>
<p>**Examples of What Might Constitute a Public Policy Violation: **</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Criminal matters</strong>: Arbitrators cannot impose criminal penalties; such matters lie with courts</li>
<li><strong>Procedural injustice</strong>: Gross denial of due process</li>
<li><strong>Awards affecting non-parties</strong>: Breach of procedural or substantive fairness involving third-party rights</li>
<li><strong>Contravention of international obligations or national economic regulation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Awards based on fraud or corruption</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-the-unreasonableness-test">B. The Unreasonableness Test</span></h3><p>One fundamental question arises when determining whether an arbitral award should be challenged based on public policy: <em>What constitutes unreasonableness?</em> If an arbitral decision is so extreme or perverse that no reasonable arbitrator would have issued it, then it may fall under the category of violating public policy. However, it is crucial to note that merely disagreeing with the outcome of an award or finding it unfair does not make it a public policy violation. This principle has been consistently raised in applications to set aside or refuse enforcement of awards.</p>
<p>The concept of public policy can often be linked to domestic law, with some suggesting that any violation of a country’s domestic law should be enough to set aside an award. But it is more complex. Public policy may also involve violations of mandatory rules, such as those pertaining to criminal law, family law, or areas affecting third parties, like competition law. A key example is when an arbitral award might violate international policies or treaties.</p>
<p>In discussing public policy, we are not just considering domestic laws but also international laws, including treaties. The overarching principle, however, is that public policy exceptions are to be interpreted restrictively.</p>
<h3><span id="c-restrictive-approach">C. Restrictive Approach</span></h3><p>Despite the potentially expansive character of public policy, courts in most jurisdictions are very reluctant to invoke the public policy exception.</p>
<p>Courts have underscored the narrow, exceptional character of the public policy defence in recognition proceedings.</p>
<p>To avoid opening the floodgates, courts are reluctant to use public policy as a ground for refusal unless the violation is so fundamental that it affects the core values of the legal system. Courts often emphasize that public policy exceptions are narrow and only apply in exceptional cases where the fundamental principles of justice are breached.</p>
<p>Courts would uphold a public policy ground to refuse recognition and enforcement of an award only when the most fundamental and core values of a legal system have been deviated from.</p>

<h4><span id="1-united-states-parsons-amp-whittemore-case">1. United States — <em>Parsons &amp; Whittemore case</em></span></h4><p>According to the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws, a foreign arbitral award can only be refused on public policy grounds if enforcing the award would violate the basic notions of morality and justice. While these terms are vague, they reflect the need for public policy exceptions to be reserved for the most extreme cases.</p>
<p>Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co. v. Societe General de l’Industrie du Papier (RAKTA), 508 F2d 969, 977 (2d Cir 1974). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more probative, however, are the inferences to be drawn from the history of the Convention as a whole. <u>The general pro-enforcement bias informing the Convention and explaining its supersession of the Geneva Convention points toward a narrow reading of the public policy defense.</u> <u>An expensive construction of this defense would vitiate the Convention’s basic effort to remove preexisting obstacles to enforcement.</u><br>We conclude, therefore, that the Convention’s public policy defense should be construed narrowly. <u>Enforcement of foreign arbitral awards may be denied on this basis only where enforcement would violate the forum state’s most basic notions of morality and justice.</u><br>Cf. 1 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF THE CONFLICT OF LAWS S 117, comment c, at 340 (1971); Loucks v.

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>public policy defence must be interpreted narrowly</strong>.</li>
<li>Enforcement can only be refused if it <strong>violates the most basic ideas of morality and justice</strong> in the United States.</li>
<li>Courts <strong>should not lightly use</strong> public policy to block enforcement, or it would defeat the whole point of the New York Convention (which is to make enforcement easier).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-england-deutsche-schachtbau-case">2. England — <em>Deutsche Schachtbau case</em></span></h4><p>In cases like the <em>Deutsche Schöpfung</em> case, the English courts have held that an arbitral award may only be set aside if it is clearly injurious to the public good or wholly offensive to the ordinary, reasonable, and fully informed public.</p>
<p>Deutsche Schachtbau-und Tiefbohrgesellschaft m.b.H. v. Shell International Petroleum Co. Ltd., Court of Appeal, England and Wales, 24 March 1987, [1990] 1 A.C. 295</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[e]ncompasses cases where “the enforcement of the award would be clearly injurious to the public good or, possibly, enforcement would be wholly oﬀensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public on whose behalf the powers of the state are exercised”; [c]onsiderations of public policy can never be exhaustively deﬁned, but they should be approached with extreme caution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The English Court said public policy means enforcement would have to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clearly harmful to the public good</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Totally offensive</strong> to an ordinary, reasonable, well-informed member of the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>Courts should use the public policy exception <strong>very carefully and cautiously</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="3-switzerland-x-spa-v-y-srl">3. Switzerland — <em>X S.p.A. v. Y S.r.l.</em></span></h4><p>Swiss courts allow an award to be set aside if it disregards widely recognized values that form the basis of any legal order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An arbitral award contravenes public policy “if it disregards essential and widely recognized values which, according to the conceptions prevailing in Switzerland, should form the basis of any legal order”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Switzerland, a public policy violation happens <strong>only</strong> if an award <strong>ignores essential and widely accepted values</strong> — values that are <strong>foundational to any legal system</strong> in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Again, a <strong>very high threshold</strong> is required.</p>

<h4><span id="5-hong-kong-hebei-import-amp-export-case">5. Hong Kong — <em>Hebei Import &amp; Export case</em></span></h4><p>In Hong Kong, the landmark case of <em>Hebei Imported Export v. Polytech</em> (1999) offers the leading judicial position on public policy. The judgment, issued by Justice Bukhari, holds that an arbitral award may be set aside if it is so fundamentally offensive to the jurisdiction’s notions of justice that it cannot reasonably be overlooked. This case remains a cornerstone in Hong Kong’s legal framework on public policy.</p>
<p>Hebei Import &amp; Export Corp. v. Polytek Engineering Co. Ltd., Court of Final Appeal, Hong Kong, 9 February 1999, [1999] 2 HKC 205</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my judgment, the position is as follows. Before a Convention jurisdiction can, in keeping with its being a party to the Convention, refuse enforcement of a Convention award on public policy grounds, the award must be so fundamentally offensive to that jurisdiction’s notions of justice that, despite its being a party to the Convention, it cannot reasonably be expected to overlook the objection. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Hong Kong, the court said an award must be <strong>so fundamentally offensive</strong> to Hong Kong’s concept of justice that <strong>it would be unreasonable</strong> to enforce it.</p>
<p>Hong Kong courts also apply the <strong>narrow, exceptional approach</strong> to public policy defenses.</p>
<h3><span id="d-public-policy-national-policy">D. Public Policy ≠ National Policy</span></h3><h4><span id="1-national-policy-vs-international-public-policy">1. National Policy vs. International Public Policy</span></h4><p>The distinction between <strong>national policy</strong> and <strong>international public policy</strong> is key when discussing challenges to the enforcement of arbitral awards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Policy</strong>: This refers to a country’s <strong>domestic laws and political interests</strong>. However, in international arbitration, national policy alone is generally <strong>not enough</strong> to prevent enforcement of an award.</li>
<li><strong>International Public Policy</strong>: This considers broader principles, often embedded in <strong>international conventions like the New York Convention</strong>, and must align with <strong>global legal standards</strong>. Public policy in this context is more <strong>supranational</strong> and focuses on principles that apply across borders.</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen in various cases, when we deal with public policy in arbitration, it is not enough to simply focus on domestic law. Instead, we must consider international legal instruments and agreements like the New York Convention. This broadens the scope of what constitutes public policy and includes considerations that go beyond national legal interests.</p>
<p>For instance, a US court addressed a case where an arbitral award was challenged on the grounds that it conflicted with US domestic law. However, the court rejected the challenge, emphasizing that public policy in this context is not just about national legal positions but must align with the broader international framework, such as the New York Convention.</p>
<p>A similar issue arose in the US case involving the Ministry of Defense and the Islamic Republic of Iran (2011), where a challenge was raised against the enforcement of an award in favor of Iran. The court ruled that national policy alone does not suffice to justify the non-enforcement of an award, especially when international law is involved.</p>

<p><strong>What Overseas Is Arguing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. cut ties with Egypt, and the government (specifically AID) stopped funding Overseas’ contract with an Egyptian company (RAKTA).</li>
<li>Overseas says: <em>“As a loyal American company, we had to drop the project because the U.S. government no longer supported it.”</em></li>
<li>They claim that if a court forces them to go back and finish the project (despite U.S. policy), it would <strong>violate U.S. public policy</strong>—meaning U.S. courts shouldn’t enforce such a ruling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Court Ruling</strong>: The court rejected the challenge, clarifying that <strong>national policy</strong> alone cannot prevent enforcement. The public policy defense must be <strong>narrow</strong> and <strong>aligned with international legal standards</strong>, particularly the <strong>New York Convention</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Court Disagrees:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“National Policy” ≠ “Public Policy”</strong><ul>
<li>Overseas is mixing up <strong>government political decisions</strong> (like cutting ties with Egypt) with <strong>legal public policy</strong> (fundamental moral&#x2F;legal principles).</li>
<li>The court says: <em>“Just because the U.S. and Egypt had a fight doesn’t mean enforcing this contract is morally or legally unacceptable.”</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Convention (International Agreement) Has a Strict Definition of “Public Policy”</strong><ul>
<li>The <strong>New York Convention</strong> (which governs international arbitration) only allows courts to reject foreign rulings in <strong>extreme cases</strong> (like fraud or serious injustice).</li>
<li>If courts could block rulings just because of <strong>political disputes</strong>, it would create a <strong>huge loophole</strong>—every country could ignore arbitration awards they don’t like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><u>In equating “national” policy with United States “public” policy, the appellant quite plainly misses the mark.</u> <u>To read the public policy defense as a parochial device protective of national political interests would seriously undermine the Convention’s utility.</u> This provision was not meant to enshrine the vagaries of international politics under the rubric of “public policy.” Rather, a circumscribed public policy doctrine was contemplated by the Convention’s framers and every indication is that the United States, in acceding to the Convention, meant to subscribe to this supranational emphasis. Cf. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., U.S., 42 U.S.L.W. 4911, 4915-16 n. 15 (June 17, 1974).5<br>To deny enforcement of this award largely because of the United States falling out with Egypt in recent years would mean converting a defense intended to be of narrow scope into a major loophole in the Convention’s mechanism for enforcement. We have little hesitation, therefore, in disallowing Overseas proposed public policy defense.</p>

<h5><span id="2-ministry-of-defense-amp-iran-case-us-2011">(2) Ministry of Defense &amp; Iran Case (US, 2011)</span></h5><p><strong>Background</strong>: A challenge to enforce an award in favor of Iran based on US sanctions and foreign policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iran’s Ministry of Defense</strong> (successor to Iran’s old Ministry of War) won an arbitration award against <strong>Cubic Defense Systems, Inc.</strong> (a U.S. company) in an <strong>international arbitration</strong> (ICC case).</li>
<li>Cubic tried to block enforcement of the award in U.S. court, arguing that <strong>U.S. sanctions and hostile relations with Iran</strong> made it against <strong>U.S. public policy</strong> to enforce the ruling.</li>
<li>The <strong>U.S. government</strong> (as a “friend of the court” or <em>amicus curiae</em>) supported enforcing the award, saying it <strong>did not violate U.S. policy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Court Ruling</strong>: The court confirmed that <strong>national policy</strong> expressions <strong>cannot override</strong> international enforcement principles under the <strong>New York Convention</strong>. National policy is relevant but must be <strong>weighed</strong> against the <strong>international framework</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“National Policy” ≠ Automatic Bar to Enforcement</strong><ul>
<li>Just because the U.S. and Iran have <strong>bad relations or sanctions</strong> doesn’t automatically mean enforcing an arbitration award is against <strong>U.S. public policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Courts have ruled before (like in <em>Parsons Whittemore</em>) that letting <strong>political disputes</strong> block arbitration awards would <strong>weaken international business law</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>But the U.S. Government’s Opinion Matters</strong><ul>
<li>Since Cubic argued that <strong>U.S.-Iran tensions</strong> should prevent enforcement, the court looked at what the U.S. government said.</li>
<li>The government confirmed that <strong>enforcing this award would NOT harm U.S. policy</strong>—so the court gave that view <strong>heavy weight</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ministry of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as Successor in Interest to the Ministry of War of the Government of Iran v. Cubic Defense Systems, Inc, Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, United States of America, 15 December 2011, 665 F.3d 1091.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, as noted, the United States as amicus curiae supports affirmance of the district court’s confirmation of the ICC’s award. An expression of national policy is not necessarily dispositive of the public policy issue under the Convention. See Parsons Whittemore, 508 F.2d at 974 (“To read the public policy defense as a parochial device protective of national political interests would seriously undermine the Convention’s utility.”). Nonetheless, given Cubic’s invocation of our country’s fraught relationship with Iran as expressed through various trade sanctions, the government’s confirma- tion that the ICC’s award comports with the national and for- eign policy of the United States is entitled to great weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Political tensions alone</strong> usually <strong>aren’t enough</strong> to ignore an arbitration award. Courts <strong>won’t let companies use “public policy” as an excuse</strong> just because their government doesn’t like the other country. But if the <strong>U.S. government itself says enforcement is okay</strong>, that’s a <strong>strong argument in favor</strong>.</p>
<h5><span id="3-eco-swiss-china-time-ltd-v-benetton-1999-eu">(3) Eco Swiss China Time Ltd v. Benetton (1999, EU)</span></h5><p><strong>Background</strong>: A case concerning whether <strong>mandatory EU law</strong> (Article 85 EC Treaty) could override an arbitral award.</p>
<p><strong>Court Ruling</strong>: The court ruled that <strong>EU competition law</strong> was so fundamental that <strong>the award was void</strong> under <strong>EU law</strong>, <strong>demonstrating the supremacy of mandatory national laws</strong>.</p>
<p>Eco Swiss China Time Ltd v. Benetton International NV, [1999] ECR 1–3055</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, according to Article 3(g) of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 3(1)(g)EC), Article 85 of the Treaty constitutes a fundamental provision which is essential for the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the Community and, in particular, for the functioning of the internal market. The importance of such a provision led the framers of the Treaty to provide expressly, in Article 85(2) of the Treaty, that any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to that article are to be automatically void.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span id="4-mandatory-rules-of-law-non-derogable-by-contract">4. Mandatory Rules of Law (Non-Derogable by Contract)</span></h4><p>Certain legal principles are so essential that <strong>they cannot be waived</strong> by agreement in arbitration. These principles are embedded in <strong>public policy</strong> and <strong>mandatory rules of law</strong>.</p>
<p>In the context of the European Union (EU), for instance, certain provisions of the <strong>EC Treaty</strong> (now part of EU law) create mandatory rules, such as those related to the internal common market. These rules bind member states together and cannot be violated by private agreements, including arbitral awards.</p>
<p>In Eco Swiss v. Benetton (1999), Article 85 of the EC Treaty (on competition law) was treated as a mandatory rule. The Court held that an arbitral award that violated such mandatory EU rules could not be enforced, as this would breach public policy.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory rules</strong> reflect <strong>deep, core values</strong> of a legal system. If an arbitral award <strong>violates these rules</strong>, <strong>enforcement may be refused</strong> on <strong>public policy grounds</strong>. However, the threshold remains <strong>very high</strong> — trivial or procedural issues are <strong>not enough</strong>. <strong>Public policy</strong> includes <strong>domestic public policy</strong> applied to international disputes (per Hebei case).</p>
<p>“Public Policy” is not about every little rule. It’s about the core values of justice and fairness in a country. Courts apply their own deep values, even in international cases.</p>
<p>e.g. In Hong Kong (Hebei case), actual bias is a serious issue, but small procedural mistakes won’t stop enforcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr Justice Bokhary PJ: “In regard to the refusal of enforcement of Convention awards on public policy grounds, there are references in the cases and texts to what has been called “international public policy”. Does this mean some standard common to all civilized nations? Or does it mean those elements of a State’s own public policy which are so fundamental to its notions of justice that its courts feel obliged to apply the same not only to purely internal matters but even to matters with a foreign element by which other States are affected? I think that it should be taken to mean the latter. If it were the former, it would become so difficult of ascertainment that a court may well feel obliged as the Supreme Court of India did in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd v. General Electric Co. Yearbook Comm. Arb’n XX (1995) 681 at p.700  to abandon the search for it.<br>“In the present context, I think that a distinction can and should be made between the effect of actual bias and that of apparent bias. [……] Actual bias would be more than our courts could overlook even where the award concerned is a Convention award. But short of actual bias, I do not think that the Hong Kong courts would be justified in refusing enforcement of a Convention award on public policy grounds as soon as appearances fall short of what we insist upon in regard to impartiality where domestic cases or arbitrations are concerned. Our stance must be that something more serious even than that is required for refusing such enforcement. In adopting such a stance, we would be proceeding in conformity with the stance generally adopted in regard to Convention award enforcement by the commercial jurisdictions whose decisions from around the globe have been cited to us by leading counsel for the buyer.”</p>

<h3><span id="c-ila-report-on-public-policy-2002">C. ILA Report on Public Policy (2002)</span></h3><p>In 2002, the <strong>International Law Association (ILA)</strong> tried to make it easier for courts around the world to <strong>understand and apply public policy</strong> in arbitration cases.</p>
<p>They published a report to <strong>give clear guidance</strong> on when a court should <strong>refuse to enforce an arbitral award</strong> based on public policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respect</strong> the final decision of arbitrators.</li>
<li><strong>Only</strong> reject awards in <strong>very exceptional situations</strong>, when enforcing the award would break <strong>international public policy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final Report on Public Policy as a Bar to Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards made recommendations in relation to public policy as a ground for refusal to enforce.</p>
<p>Key recommendations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Courts must <strong>respect</strong> the <strong>finality</strong> of international arbitration awards.</li>
<li><strong>Public policy defenses</strong> should be <strong>very limited</strong> — <strong>only used in rare and serious cases</strong>.</li>
<li>Such exceptional circumstances may in particular be found to exist if recognition or enforcement of the international arbitral award would be against international public policy. Courts must think about <strong>international public policy</strong>, not just their own domestic rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify which rules are forming the public policy of any State, the ILA Recommendations provided three categories: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental principles</li>
<li>Public Policy Rules</li>
<li>International Obligations</li>
</ul>

<h4><span id="1-fundamental-principles">1. Fundamental principles</span></h4><p>Category 1: Fundamental principles pertaining to justice or morality, that the state wishes to protect even when it is not directly concerned. ➡️ Basic principles of <strong>justice or morality</strong> that every country protects, even if the country is not directly involved in the case.</p>
<p>The court verifying the arbitral award conformity with fundamental principles should do so by reference to those (substantive and procedural) principles considered fundamental in its own legal system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Substantive principles</p>
<p>e.g. No abuse of rights (you can’t use your rights to harm others unfairly).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Procedural principles</p>
<p>e.g. The arbitrators must be <strong>impartial</strong> (fair and neutral).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No party can waive</strong> (give up) these protections.</p>
<p>Courts must check awards based on <strong>their own country’s</strong> fundamental principles.</p>
<h4><span id="2-public-policy-rules-lois-de-police">2. Public Policy Rules (“Lois de police”)</span></h4><p>Category 2: Public Policy Rules designed to serve the essential political, social or economic interests of the State, these being known as “lois de police” or “public policy rules”. ➡️ Special laws made to protect the country’s <strong>essential political, social, or economic interests</strong>.</p>
<p>e.g. <strong>Competition law</strong> (antitrust laws) — making sure companies compete fairly, not form illegal monopolies.</p>
<p>An award contrary to a rule of public policy is to be refused to enforcement if: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) the scope of said rule is intended to encompass the situation under consideration; and </p>
<p>(ii) recognition or enforcement of the award would manifestly disrupt the essential political, social or economic interests protected by the rule.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span id="3-international-obligations">3. International Obligations</span></h4><p>Category 3: Obligations – the duty of the State to respect its obligations towards other States or international organisations.</p>
<p>An example of an international obligation is a United Nations resolution imposing sanctions. </p>
<p>Some rules, such as those prohibiting corruption, fall into more than one category.</p>
<h2><span id="iii-what-constitutes-public-policy">III. What Constitutes Public Policy?</span></h2><p><img src="/../images/6157/image-20250421222958395.png" alt="image-20250421222958395"></p>
<h3><span id="a-illegality">A. Illegality</span></h3><p>In arbitration, sometimes the <strong>contract or its performance</strong> might involve <strong>illegal acts</strong>.</p>
<p>But — <strong>not all illegalities automatically destroy a contract or award</strong>! Courts look very carefully at how serious the illegality is.</p>
<h4><span id="1-illegality-in-place-of-performance">1. Illegality in Place of Performance</span></h4><p>It is important to understand that <strong>illegality in the place of performance</strong> does not automatically render a contract (or its related arbitral award) unenforceable.</p>
<p>In <strong>England</strong>, for instance, if a contract is <strong>legal under the governing law of the contract</strong> and <strong>legal under the law of the seat</strong>, the fact that its performance would be illegal in the place of performance <strong>does not, by itself, make the award unenforceable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong>: Enforcement must be <strong>clearly injurious to the public good</strong> or <strong>wholly offensive</strong> to public policy to refuse recognition (Shoprite case reference).</p>
<h4><span id="2-seriousness-of-illegality">2. Seriousness of Illegality</span></h4><p>Courts will <strong>balance</strong> two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect the <strong>finality</strong> of arbitration decisions.</li>
<li>Protect the <strong>public good</strong> against serious illegality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Points (from RBRG Trading v Sinocore and other cases):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the contract itself is <strong>deeply illegal</strong> (e.g., a contract to share stolen goods), enforcement <strong>can be refused</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Minor illegality</strong> in performance is usually <strong>not enough</strong>.</li>
<li>Courts must <strong>separate domestic policy</strong> from <strong>international public policy</strong>.</li>
<li>If a contract was <strong>clearly made to break foreign law</strong>, enforcement might be refused.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public policy is a <strong>very serious matter</strong> — it should only block enforcement if the award is <strong>clearly harmful</strong> to society.</p>

<p><strong>⚖️ RBRG Trading (UK) Limited v Sinocore International Co Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 838 (quoting from Dicey, Morris and Collins Conflict of Laws)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Principles to be drawn from English authorities:<ul>
<li>If the underlying contract is in itself contrary to public policy (e.g. a contract to share the proceeds of crime), the award may be refused enforcement on the grounds of public policy</li>
<li>It is important to distinguish between domestic public policy in English law and considerations of international public policy applied by the English courts so as to disapply foreign law or refuse to enforce an arbitral award, as the case may be.</li>
<li>The mere fact that the performance of the contract may be illegal in the place of performance, without more, will not render an award on the basis of such a contract unenforceable in England, where the contract is legal by its applicable law and by the lex arbitri</li>
<li>If it is apparent on the face of the award that the contract was made with the intention of violating the law of a foreign friendly State, then the enforcement of an award rendered on the basis of such a contract may be contrary to English public policy.</li>
<li>The court has to perform a balancing exercise between the finality that prima facie should exist particularly for those that agree to have their disputes arbitrated, against the policy of ensuring that the enforcement power of the English court is not abused</li>

<p>Considerations of public policy can never be exhaustively defined, but they should be approached with extreme caution… It has to be shown that there is some element of illegality or that the enforcement of the award would be clearly injurious to the public good or, possibly, that enforcement would be wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonably and fully informed member of the public on whose behalf the powers of the state are exercised.</p>

<p>⚖️ <strong>G v N  [2023] HKCFI 3366</strong></p>
<p>A recent important case demonstrating evolving approaches to illegality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Facts</strong>:</p>
<p>Arbitration administered by HKIAC.</p>
<p>G wanted money back after a failed share transfer. N said the deal was <strong>illegal</strong>. The arbitrator made a decision under the <strong>old law</strong> (Tinsley v Milligan).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Context</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under <strong>English law</strong>, previously the <strong>Tinsley v. Milligan</strong> (1993) “reliance test” applied: A party relying on its own illegal act could not recover.</li>
<li><strong>Patel v. Mirza (2016)</strong> changed the test: Courts should consider a <strong>range of factors</strong> to determine whether enforcement would be contrary to public policy.</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong</strong> adopted the <em>Patel</em> approach — but <strong>five days after the arbitrator</strong> had issued the award.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>N applied to set aside the award, arguing it conflicted with Hong Kong’s new public policy on illegality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Court’s Decision</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No error of law</strong> by the arbitrator — the award was made according to the law at the time of decision.</li>
<li><strong>However</strong>, because public policy may have shifted regarding illegality, the court decided to <strong>remit</strong> the matter to the arbitrator for reconsideration based on the <em>current</em> Hong Kong law.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Debate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Criticism</strong>: Some argue the court improperly treated a <strong>change in law</strong> as a public policy violation, contrary to the high threshold (serious offensiveness) required by Hebei.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>: Others argue that illegality is so <strong>fundamental</strong> to the concept of justice that even a change in approach to illegality justifies reconsideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>G initiated arbitration against N for restitution of monies paid in consideration for a share transfer.  N contested the arbitration on the basis that the share transfer had been tainted by illegality due to a breach of BVI law.<br>Arbitrator issued partial award upholding the illegality defense, applying the test in Tinsley v Milligan, which was, at the time, the leading case on illegality defenses (i.e. that the party must not rely on illegal conduct in order to be granted relief).<br>Several days after issuance of award, Hong Kong Court of Appeal issued decision in Monat Investment Ltd v All Person(s) In Occupation of Part of The Remaining Portion of Lot No 591 in Mui Wo DD 4 No 16 Ma Po Tsuen, Mui Wo, Lantau Island [2023] HKCA 479 (“Monat”), changing the position on illegality from that in Tinsley v Milligan to that in Patel v Mirza (i.e., that the court needs to look at a range of factors before applying the illegality defense).<br>G applied to set aside the Partial Award on public policy grounds.  Court determined that it could review the award and in light of the change in position in Hong Kong law, remanded the award back to the Tribunal for reconsideration.</p>

India (2009)</strong> and other cases, it was clarified that <strong>illegality in performance</strong> does not automatically invalidate a contract or award.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reyes</strong> in a Hong Kong case emphasized:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a party believes the award involves illegality, the <strong>first step</strong> should be to apply to the <strong>supervising court at the seat</strong> of arbitration.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement courts should not override the supervisory court</strong> without a compelling reason.</li>
<li>Public policy objections based on illegality should first be raised at the seat.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <strong>different courts take different views</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some courts recognize that if enforcement would involve illegality under <strong>local law</strong>, the enforcement court has authority to refuse recognition under <strong>Article V(2)(b)</strong> of the New York Convention.</li>

<p>it was unclear whether the tribunal had thoroughly considered the issues of illegality raised by the Respondent”, and the Court had “serious reservations as to the reasons given by the tribunal as to why the Respondent’s claims were dismissed.<br>In the case of R v F [2012] 5 HKLRD 278 the Hong Kong court set out the necessary scope of such reasoning. The Court found that the reasons given “need not be elaborate or lengthy, provided they could be understood in its proper context”.<br>The reasons may be short, so long as the factual and legal basis is explained and the reasoning is expressed to enable the parties to understand how, and why, a finding is made on a material issue, and how a conclusion is reached by the tribunal”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court therefore set aside the Order under section 95(3)(b) of the AO.</p>
<p>As a procedural matter, an award should show sufficient reasoning. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The claims made by the respondent as to the sham transactions of supply of materials being loans in disguise are credible, and supported by the evidence of Mr Y from HD. The allegations of such unlawful loans creating false increments in the financial records of HD and MD all raise serious consequences of illegality and possible offences under PRC law. They should be thoroughly considered by the tribunal, and the dismissal of such claims should be adequately explained. <u>The reasons may be short, so long as the factual and legal basis are explained and the reasoning is expressed to enable the parties to understand how, and why, a finding is made on a material issue, and how a conclusion is reached by the tribunal</u> (R v F[2012] 5 HKLRD 278, [2012] HKCU 1912, applied in S Co v B Co 2014] 6 HKC 421, HCCT 12&#x2F;2013, 24 July 2014). In the context of the issues raised in the Arbitration, I regret that the tribunal failed to give any adequate reason as to why it had concluded that the respondent’s claim of illegality of the underlying Debt had not been established by the respondent. and should be dismissed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court therefore set aside the Order under section 95(3)(b) of the AO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important issue of whether the underlying HD Contracts and MD Contracts were illegal and unenforceable under PRC law, so as to render the Guarantee void and unenforceable against the respondent, <u>is not in my view addressed in the Award with adequate reasons, and it would offend our Court’s notions of fairness and justice to enforce the Award when it might be tainted by illegality, and when a significant issue brought before the tribunal for determination has not been seen to be properly considered and determined</u>, contrary to the parties’ legitimate and reasonable expectations.</p>

<p>⚖️ <strong>U v A [2017] HKEC 468</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Application to set aside an Order for enforcement of an ICC award rendered in Hong Kong, on three grounds including that it would be contrary to public policy and unjust to enforce the Award. Respondents complained that the arbitrator had unjustifiably refused to admit a PRC Judgment as evidence in the arbitration, such that the Respondents were deprived of a full opportunity to present their case on a key issue.</li>
<li>Held: Error in (PRC) law is not contrary to Hong Kong public policy, nor is it unjust (Hebei Import &amp; Export Corp v Polytek Engineering Co Ltd (1999) 2 HKCFAR 111).</li>
<li>To justify refusing enforcement, the violation of public policy must be “contrary to the fundamental conceptions of morality and justice” of the forum – i.e. Hong Kong.</li>
<li>The Court held that Hong Kong is not the correct forum to decide whether the award would violate PRC public policy, nor can it review the decision of the arbitrator that the agreement did not require approval under PRC law. To the extent that enforcement of the award is sought in the PRC, the Respondents are free to resist enforcement there.</li>
<li>The Court rejected the application to set aside on each ground and ordered the Respondents to pay costs on the indemnity basis.</li>

<p>⚖️ <strong>JVL Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd [2016] SGHC 126</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the Tribunal’s primary findings was based on an argument that (i) only raised briefly in the oral submissions, at the tribunal’s request; (ii) not fully pleaded by Agritrade; and (iii) never responded to by the losing party.</li>
<li>The court initially set aside the proceedings for six months to give the tribunal an opportunity to reconsider its award and to receive further submissions if necessary. The tribunal declined to do so.</li>
<li>The court decided that the award itself should be set aside as the Tribunal had “deprived JVL of its right to present evidence and address submissions” by exercising “unreasonable initiative” on the collateral contract question. </li>
<li>The tribunal must confine itself to the issues selected by the parties for determination, recognising that parties’ ability to mutually determine the scope of the arbitration is considered one of the touchstones of arbitration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Equal rights</strong> must be afforded to both parties.</p>
<p>Whether a point comes from another party or the tribunal itself, <strong>both sides must have a chance to respond</strong>.</p>
<p>This links to a broader phenomenon called <strong>“due process paranoia”</strong> — arbitrators are now extremely careful, constantly inviting comments, to avoid having awards set aside.</p>
<p>⚖️ <strong>BZV v BZW and another [2021] SGHC 60</strong></p>
<p>The Court addressed the issue of whether the requisite elements to set aside an award under section 24(b) of the IAA have been met, specifically:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether and which rule of natural justice was breached;</li>
<li>The manner in which the rule of natural justice had been breached;</li>
<li>Whether there was a connection between the breach and the making of the award; and</li>
<li>Whether prejudice was caused to the plaintiff’s rights by the breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Court found that Tribunal had breached the fair hearing rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tribunal adopted a chain of reasoning which had no nexus to the parties’ cases (in respect of particular claims)</li>
<li>The Tribunal failed to apply its mind to an essential issue arising from the parties’ arguments</li>

<h4><span id="3-short-key-ideas">3. Short Key Ideas</span></h4><p><strong>Fair opportunity</strong>: Every party must be heard properly.</p>

<h3><span id="e-novel-situations">E. Novel Situations</span></h3><p>While <strong>illegality</strong> and <strong>fraud</strong> are traditional grounds for setting aside awards based on public policy, other <strong>modern complexities</strong> are emerging.</p>
<h4><span id="1-due-process-as-a-catch-all">1. Due Process as a “Catch-All”</span></h4><p>Due process issues represent a <strong>“catch-all”</strong> ground for setting aside awards, distinct from classic grounds like:</p>

<li><strong>Fraud</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While those are clear-cut, due process arguments are often <strong>more subjective</strong> and involve:</p>

<h4><span id="3-negative-jurisdictional-awards">3. Negative Jurisdictional Awards</span></h4><p>In Hong Kong, there is <strong>no appeal</strong> from a tribunal’s <strong>negative jurisdictional ruling</strong> (where the tribunal says it lacks jurisdiction).</p>
<p>Appeal is different from setting aside. Appeals allow <strong>de novo</strong> (fresh) review for positive jurisdictional findings but <strong>not for negative ones</strong>.</p>
<p>However, it’s <strong>undecided</strong> whether a party can <strong>set aside</strong> a negative jurisdictional award on public policy or due process grounds. No case law currently answers this question directly. This could be a fertile area for <strong>research papers</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="4-practical-reality-for-clients">4. Practical Reality for Clients</span></h4><p>Clients often want to set aside awards they are unhappy with. Lawyers must explain that <strong>setting aside an award is not a second appeal</strong>. Public policy challenges are <strong>rarely successful</strong> — <strong>less than 1%</strong> of awards are set aside on these grounds.</p>
<h4><span id="5-key-cases">5. Key Cases</span></h4><p>⚖️ <strong>Shanghai Fusheng Soya-Food Co Ltd v Pulmuone Holdings Co Ltd [2014] HKEC 825</strong></p>
<p>Applicants argued the tribunal ignored a favorable PRC court judgment.</p>
<p>Tribunal had <strong>already closed</strong> proceedings and refused to accept new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Held:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only breaches affecting the <strong>structural integrity</strong> of arbitration (not substantive errors) justify setting aside under <strong>Article 34</strong> of the Model Law.</li>
<li><strong>Finality principle:</strong> Errors by arbitrators do <strong>not automatically</strong> mean the award violates public policy.</li>
<li>Courts retain a <strong>residual discretion</strong> to enforce even if a public policy ground is proven.</li>
</ul>
<p>The applicants argued that the arbitral award should be set aside because the arbitral tribunal had failed to take into account an earlier PRC court judgment, which was partially in favour of the applicants. The tribunal had taken the position that no further submissions or evidence (including the judgment) could be produced as it had already declared the arbitral proceedings closed.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the fundamental conceptions of morality and justice of the law of the forum”. </p>
<p>Specifically, for setting aside an arbitral award under Article 34 of the Model Law, the court will only consider the public policy objection in terms of the structural integrity of the arbitration proceedings and not the substantive merits of the dispute or the correctness of the award. </p>
<p>By choosing arbitration, parties should be aware that arbitral awards are binding and final. The public policy’s bias towards enforcement cannot be counterbalanced by the mere fact that there was an error by an arbitrator.</p>
<p>Also noted that under the Model Law, Courts have a residual discretion to enforce awards despite the proven existence of a valid public policy ground.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dispute: Cryptocurrency wealth management agreement.</li>
<li>Tribunal awarded damages for breach of contract (failure to deliver Bitcoin).</li>
<li><strong>Held:</strong><ul>
<li>Bitcoin does <strong>not</strong> have legal tender status under PRC law.</li>
<li>Award ordering Bitcoin-related compensation <strong>contravened</strong> PRC policy and <strong>violated public interest</strong>.</li>
<li>Court <strong>set aside</strong> the arbitral award on public policy grounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dispute arose from agreement for cryptocurrency wealth management. Award rendered for breach of contract for failure to deliver cryptocurrency as agreed by parties, Tribunal awarded damages for breach.</p>
<p>Court found that Bitcoin does not have the same legal status as fiat currency, and cannot and should not be circulated in the market. Chinese law essentially prohibits redemption, trading and circulation of Bitcoin in PRC.</p>
<p>Court held that Tribunal’s order for compensation equated to redemption, which contravenes the spirit of PRC policies and violates the public interest. It therefore set aside the arbitral award.</p>

<li>Passed on <strong>14 June 2017</strong>, effective from <strong>1 January 2018</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><ul>
<li>To <strong>confirm</strong> that <strong>disputes involving Intellectual Property (IP) rights</strong> are <strong>arbitrable</strong> in Hong Kong.</li>
<li>To <strong>clarify</strong> that enforcing arbitral awards concerning IP rights is <strong>not contrary</strong> to <strong>Hong Kong public policy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the amendment, there was <strong>uncertainty</strong> over whether IP disputes — especially involving issues like validity — could be settled by arbitration.</p>
<p>This change <strong>reinforces Hong Kong’s position</strong> as an <strong>arbitration-friendly</strong> jurisdiction, especially for <strong>technology and innovation sectors</strong> where IP is crucial.</p>

Introduction</span></h2><h3><span id="a-what-are-interlocutory-proceedings">A. What are Interlocutory Proceedings?</span></h3><p>Interlocutory Proceedings are applications at any stage, prior to trial, of existing (or contemplated) proceedings for an order or ruling of the arbitral panel (or the court) on a particular issue. </p>
<p>Interlocutory Proceedings can be made after the cause of action has been commenced but before its termination (but can also occur at a stage where the underlying substantive proceedings have not yet commenced).</p>
<p>While usually “interim” measures (sometimes, temporary or provisional in nature), certain types of interlocutory orders can effectively determine a case.</p>
<p>In summary, interlocutory proceedings are an important procedural tool in a litigant’s armoury.  When used strategically, they can also create tactical advantages for a litigant.  </p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">💡 Examples of a litigation advantage / strategy?  </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>💬  Imagine you get a <strong>court order freezing your opponent’s bank account</strong>. Now, even before winning the case, your opponent is under huge pressure because they cannot use their money freely!</p>
<h3><span id="b-different-types-of-interlocutory-proceedings">B. Different Types of Interlocutory Proceedings</span></h3><h4><span id="1-purpose">1. Purpose</span></h4><p>When considering interlocutory applications, they generally fall into two broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Procedural Applications</strong>: Requests to the tribunal intended to move the case forward, such as time extensions or requests for additional evidence.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tactical Applications</strong>: Strategic moves aimed at securing an advantage for your client, such as injunctions that could significantly impact the opponent’s position.</p>
<p>Yesss, applications can be used strategically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To gain an advantage</strong>, such as tying up an opponent’s resources.</li>
<li><strong>To protect your own position</strong>, ensuring no harm occurs before the case is resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are sitting as an arbitrator, it is crucial to assess <strong>what exactly is being sought through the interlocutory application</strong> and <strong>how it fits into the broader journey from the start to the end of the case</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="2-content">2. Content</span></h4><h5><span id="1-interim-measures">(1) Interim Measures</span></h5><p><strong>Goal</strong>: Protect the situation <strong>before</strong> the final decision.</p>
<p>Applications for orders that aim to preserve the party’s rights pending final resolution (e.g. interim injunction).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Preserve the status quo and protect rights pending the final decision.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Interim injunctions preventing a party from moving assets or taking harmful action.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="2-jurisdictional-challenges">(2) Jurisdictional Challenges</span></h5><p>Applications raising judicial issues (e.g. application to challenge the arbitrator’s jurisdiction on various grounds).</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Argue that the tribunal (or court) has <strong>no right</strong> to handle the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Where a party sues in court despite an arbitration clause, you may seek an <strong>anti-suit injunction</strong> to stop the improper court proceedings and compel arbitration.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Success in such an application often <strong>terminates the court case entirely</strong>, though arbitration may still proceed separately.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="3-procedural-applications">(3) Procedural Applications</span></h5><p>Applications for an order or direction to progress the case towards the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Keep the case running smoothly.</p>
<p>These are practical applications needed to keep the case on track, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Time Extensions</strong>:</p>
<p>Commonly needed when clients delay giving instructions or unforeseen events (like illness) disrupt the original schedule.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Applications to Introduce Additional Witness or Expert Evidence</strong>:</p>
<p>Usually, arbitration sets clear timelines for presenting evidence. However, in exceptional cases—such as a key witness being temporarily incapacitated—late submissions might be allowed <strong>in the interest of justice</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Applications to Change an Expert Witness</strong>:</p>
<p>Changing an expert can raise suspicions about the reasons behind the change.</p>
<p>Example: An expert moves employment and becomes unavailable, necessitating replacement.</p>
<p>Caution: Opposing counsel will likely probe the reasons for the change to uncover any strategic weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Applications for Discovery of Specific Documents</strong>:</p>
<p>Even with standard discovery procedures, parties often believe that crucial documents are being withheld.</p>
<p>Applications for targeted discovery are very common, particularly when there’s suspicion that the opposing side either <strong>failed to search properly</strong> or <strong>intentionally withheld documents</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="c-surprising-facts">C. Surprising Facts</span></h3><h4><span id="1-applications-before-the-case-officially-begins">1. Applications Before the Case Officially Begins</span></h4><p>Sometimes, procedural steps must be taken even before formally initiating a case:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Injunctions</strong>: For example, to restrain an opponent from taking certain actions that might harm your position before the case starts. (Elizabeth will discuss injunctions in more detail later.)</li>
<li><strong>Evidence Gathering</strong>: If you believe you have a strong claim but lack necessary evidence (held by a third party), you may need to apply to obtain that information to get your case off the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-interlocutory-applications-can-be-outcome-determinative">2. Interlocutory Applications Can Be Outcome-Determinative</span></h4><p>Although interlocutory applications are often considered intermediate steps, <strong>some can effectively determine the outcome of the case</strong>.<br> For example, in cases involving fraud:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might seek an injunction to <strong>freeze assets</strong> held by a suspected fraudster.</li>
<li>If successful, even though you must still formally pursue the case, <strong>capturing the asset leaves the defendant with little room to maneuver</strong>, making the application practically determinative.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="d-examples-of-procedural-matters-to-be-dealt-with-by-way-of-interlocutory-proceedings">D. Examples of procedural matters to be dealt with by way of Interlocutory Proceedings</span></h3><p>Examples of procedural matters to be dealt with by way of Interlocutory Proceedings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications for extension of time to serve pleadings, witness statements or expert report;</li>
<li>Applications to adduce additional witness or expert evidence;</li>
<li>Applications to change experts;</li>
<li>Applications for amendment of pleadings;</li>
<li>Applications for discovery of specific documents;</li>
<li>Requests for further and better particulars;</li>
<li>Requests for interrogatories; and</li>
<li>Applications for security for costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="e-tactical-applications-in-litigation-discovery-and-interim-measures">E. Tactical Applications in Litigation: Discovery and Interim Measures</span></h3><h4><span id="1-discovery-applications">1. Discovery Applications</span></h4><p><strong>Tactic</strong>: Apply to get important documents <strong>the other side hasn’t shared</strong>.</p>
<p>In certain disputes, one tactical application that can be deployed is a <strong>request for discovery of documents</strong>. This involves identifying specific categories of documents that are relevant to the dispute but have not yet been disclosed. Alongside this request, you must provide reasons why these documents should be produced.</p>
<p>The goal is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obtain Key Information</strong>: You hope to uncover crucial evidence that could tip the balance of the case in favor of your client, increasing the likelihood of success.</li>
<li><strong>Exert Tactical Pressure</strong>: Discovery applications also compel your opponent to invest time, effort, and financial resources into responding. In litigation, it can be tactically advantageous to force the other side to expend costs, particularly if your client has greater financial resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>💬 Imagine a scenario where you represent a major corporation or a high-net-worth individual with virtually unlimited litigation funds, while the opposing party struggles financially. By initiating multiple interlocutory proceedings like discovery applications, you can increase pressure on the opponent, potentially driving them toward a more favorable negotiated settlement.</p>
<h4><span id="2-applications-for-security-for-costs">2. Applications for Security for Costs</span></h4><p><strong>Goal</strong>: Protect your client from not getting back legal costs.</p>
<p><strong>When used</strong>: If the party suing you is from a place where it’s hard to collect money (like offshore companies).</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Advantage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forces the claimant to <strong>pay money upfront</strong>.</li>
<li>Creates <strong>financial pressure</strong> immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another strategic tool is the <strong>application for security for costs</strong>. We will explore this in greater detail next week, but in essence, this application asks the court or tribunal to require the opposing party to provide security—usually by paying funds into court or into a secured bank account.</p>
<p>Security for costs aims to protect your client from the risk of being unable to recover legal costs if they ultimately win the case.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose a company incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction, such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), brings a claim against your Hong Kong-based client. Even if you successfully defend the claim and obtain a costs award, collecting that money from the BVI company could be difficult and expensive. A security for costs order helps to short-circuit this problem by ensuring funds are available upfront.</p>
<p>Moreover, requesting security places significant pressure on the claimant, as they are forced to allocate resources immediately—resources they would likely prefer to use elsewhere. Thus, a defendant who succeeds in obtaining security for costs can gain a powerful tactical advantage early in the proceedings.</p>
<h4><span id="3-interim-measures">3. Interim Measures</span></h4><h5><span id="1-purpose-and-nature-of-interim-measures">(1) Purpose and Nature of Interim Measures</span></h5><p><strong>Interim measures</strong> are a subset of interlocutory proceedings. They are primarily intended to <strong>preserve the status quo</strong> until final adjudication of the dispute.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while interim measures preserve the “status quo,” in practice, they can favor one party over the other, depending on the circumstances. Their fundamental role is to prevent one party from suffering significant or irreparable harm before the final decision is rendered.</p>
<h5><span id="2-examples-of-interim-measures">(2) Examples of Interim Measures</span></h5><ul>
<li><strong>Safeguarding Fraudulently Obtained Funds</strong>: A classic interim measure would involve freezing funds sitting in a bank account following a fraud. At this stage, the court or tribunal does not determine whether fraud has indeed occurred but takes steps to ensure that the funds remain available pending final resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving Perishable Goods</strong>: Consider a situation involving perishable goods, such as sweet corn. Party A has delivered the goods, but Party B refuses to accept them. Since sweet corn cannot be stored indefinitely, an interim measure may be necessary to determine how the goods should be handled or sold, with the proceeds held pending the dispute’s resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving Evidence</strong>: If there is a legitimate concern that an opponent might destroy or hide evidence, a party can seek an interim order requiring the preservation of that evidence—such as by making and securing copies. While most legal systems require parties to preserve evidence, an interim application may be necessary if you have reason to doubt the opponent’s reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Appointment of a Receiver</strong>: In cases where a company is being mismanaged—perhaps its directors are disregarding court orders—a court may appoint a receiver to take over the company’s operations. This ensures the company acts properly and complies with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>💬 <strong>Real Story</strong>: One real-world example involved a case in Hong Kong, where the directors of a company refused to comply with court orders. The court was persuaded to appoint a <strong>receiver</strong> over the company to ensure that the orders were properly addressed.</p>
<h2><span id="ii-what-are-interim-measures">II. What are Interim Measures?</span></h2><h3><span id="a-interim-measures">A. Interim measures</span></h3><p>Interim measures are applications for remedies or relief targeted at safeguarding the “status quo” i.e. the rights of the parties pending final resolution of the dispute by final award.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>: Two parties are fighting over a valuable painting. If we wait until the final judgment, the painting might be damaged or disappear. So the tribunal (or court) can order a temporary measure to <strong>keep the painting safe</strong>.</p>
<p>Interim Measures are orders aimed at safeguarding a party’s right which is otherwise damaged or affected irreparably due to acts or omissions of the other party before or during the adjudication.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>keep the “status quo”</strong> — meaning, things stay the way they are now, so neither side is unfairly hurt while waiting for the final decision.</li>
<li>To <strong>protect rights</strong> that might otherwise be <strong>seriously damaged</strong> or <strong>lost forever</strong> if nothing is done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes called “provisional&#x2F;conservatory measures”, “preliminary measures&#x2F;injunctions” or “emergency&#x2F;interim relief”. All these terms basically mean the <strong>same thing</strong>: a temporary solution to protect the parties’ rights.</p>
<h3><span id="b-different-types-of-interim-measures">B. Different Types of Interim Measures</span></h3><p>Interim measures can be used in different ways, depending on what is needed. Here are <strong>some examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Evidence</strong>: Protect or collect important documents, witnesses, or proof, so they are not lost or destroyed.</p>
<p> (<em>Example</em>: Freezing emails or company records before someone deletes them.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Property</strong>: Protect or control property that is part of the dispute.</p>
<p> (<em>Example</em>: Stopping the sale of a disputed building.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sale of Goods</strong>: Order the sale of goods that might spoil or lose value if they wait too long.</p>
<p>(<em>Example</em>: Selling perishable goods like fresh fruits before they rot.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interim Injunction</strong>: Temporarily stopping a party from doing something harmful.</p>
<p> (<em>Example</em>: Stopping a company from using a secret formula during the arbitration.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Appointment of Receiver</strong>: Appointing someone (a “receiver”) to <strong>manage</strong> property or a business during the dispute.</p>
<p> (<em>Example</em>: Appointing a receiver to run a hotel while two business partners are fighting over ownership.)</p>

<p>An order restraining a person from beginning or continuing an action threatening or invading the legal right of another, or compelling a person to carry out a certain act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>prohibitory injunction</strong> prevents the <strong>doing or continuation</strong> of an act that allegedly <strong>interferes with another’s legal rights</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>mandatory injunction</strong> requires someone to take <strong>positive action</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: When granted by the Tribunal, an injunction only binds the parties to the arbitration agreement but not third parties. A court can hold a party that fails to follow an injunction in contempt of court. The Tribunal cannot do that.</p>
<p>Other types of injunctions include: <strong>freezing orders</strong>, <strong>“quia timet” injunctions</strong> (to stop threats before harm happens), and others.</p>
<ul>
<li>In arbitration, everything is <strong>consensual</strong>—parties have agreed to be bound by the arbitration process. Therefore, a <strong>tribunal-ordered injunction</strong> can only <strong>bind the parties to the arbitration agreement</strong>, <strong>not third parties</strong>.</li>
<li>If you need to bind a <strong>third party</strong> (someone not bound by the arbitration agreement), you would likely need to seek relief from a <strong>court</strong> directly, rather than through the tribunal.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-court-vs-tribunal">2. Court vs. Tribunal</span></h4><p>A key distinction between <strong>court injunctions</strong> and <strong>tribunal injunctions</strong> lies in enforcement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a party <strong>disobeys a tribunal injunction</strong>, the tribunal has <strong>no power</strong> to hold the party in contempt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In contrast, <strong>a court order</strong>, even though civil in nature, can be <strong>enforced through contempt proceedings</strong>, potentially resulting in <strong>imprisonment</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, a court-issued injunction generally has <strong>more “bite”</strong> than one issued by a tribunal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-requirements-for-granting-an-injunction">B. Requirements for Granting an Injunction</span></h3><h4><span id="1-discretionary-jurisdiction">1. Discretionary Jurisdiction</span></h4><ul>
<li>The power to grant an injunction is <strong>discretionary</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>court</strong> or <strong>tribunal</strong> will weigh the elements and determine whether the applicant has justified the need for an injunction <strong>on the balance of probabilities</strong>.</li>
<li>Standard: “On the balance of probabilities” (i.e., <strong>more likely than not</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-purpose-preserving-the-status-quo">2. Purpose: Preserving the Status Quo</span></h4><ul>
<li><p>The <strong>primary purpose</strong> of an injunction is generally to <strong>preserve the status quo</strong> until the final resolution of the dispute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>However, sometimes granting an injunction can actually <strong>decide the whole case</strong> early on.</p>
<p>Example: Preventing the convening of a <strong>directors’ or shareholders’ meeting</strong> could determine the final outcome (e.g., the <strong>PCCW saga</strong> years ago).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to s. 36 Arbitration Ordinance – Art. 17A of UNCITRAL Model Law, the party applying for interim measures has to satisfy the Tribunal that:</p>
<p>Harm caused by counterparty:</p>
<ul>
<li>not adequately reparable by an award of damages;</li>
<li>substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasonable possibility that applicant succeeds on merits of claim (however, the Tribunal retains full discretion).</p>
<h4><span id="3-interim-vs-final-effect">3. Interim vs. Final Effect</span></h4><ul>
<li>Some injunctions are <strong>clearly interim</strong> (e.g., freezing orders over assets pending litigation).</li>
<li>Others, though formally interim, may <strong>effectively provide a final remedy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="c-legal-test-for-court-granted-injunctions">C. Legal Test for Court-Granted Injunctions</span></h3><p>Requirements for an interlocutory injunction are set out in the seminal case <strong>American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd (1975) AC 396</strong> – three essential conditions must be satisfied:</p>
<p><strong>Three Conditions to Satisfy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Serious Issue to be Tried</strong></p>
<p>This is a <strong>low threshold</strong>. The court only examines if there is a serious question to be tried — <strong>not</strong> a detailed investigation of prospects of success. Courts <strong>cannot</strong> resolve factual conflicts at this stage, as there is <strong>no cross-examination</strong>.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is usually <strong>very difficult</strong> to oppose an injunction by arguing there is no serious issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Adequacy of Damages</strong></p>
<p>Injunctions will <strong>not</strong> be granted if <strong>damages</strong> would be an adequate remedy.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If someone seeks an injunction to stop the sale of <strong>2,000 HSBC shares</strong>, the court may refuse because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HSBC shares are readily available on the market</strong>.</li>
<li>Damages could easily compensate for any loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In contrast:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a party breaches a contract to sell a <strong>unique item</strong>, such as a <strong>Ming dynasty vase</strong>, <strong>damages may not be adequate</strong>.</li>
<li>The unique nature of the asset makes an injunction more appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Balance of Convenience</strong></p>
<p>The harm caused to the applicant if the injunction is not granted must <strong>substantially outweigh</strong> the harm to the respondent if the injunction is granted.</p>
<p>This consideration often tips the balance in deciding whether or not to award the injunction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the applicant usually has to provide an undertaking to pay damages if the injunction is found to have been improperly obtained.</p>

<h3><span id="d-statutory-framework-arbitration-ordinance">D. Statutory Framework: Arbitration Ordinance</span></h3><h4><span id="1-section-36-conditions-for-tribunal-ordered-interim-measures">1. Section 36: Conditions for Tribunal-Ordered Interim Measures</span></h4><ul>
<li>Under <strong>Section 36</strong> of the Arbitration Ordinance: There must be a <strong>reasonable possibility</strong> that the applicant will succeed on the merits.</li>
<li>It is crucial to understand that:<ul>
<li>This is merely a <strong>provisional view</strong> at the application stage.</li>
<li>It <strong>does not bind</strong> the tribunal’s final adjudication on the substantive dispute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>⚡ <strong>Important</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 36 criteria <strong>do not apply</strong> when interim measures are sought from the <strong>court</strong> under <strong>Section 5</strong>.</li>
<li>Different legal tests govern court applications and tribunal applications — <strong>care must be taken to apply the correct standard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-court-ordered-interim-measures-section-45">2. Court-Ordered Interim Measures (Section 45)</span></h4><p><strong>Section 45</strong> governs the <strong>Hong Kong Court’s</strong> ability to grant <strong>interim measures</strong> in support of arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>These measures can be granted <strong>whether</strong> the arbitration is <strong>commenced or yet to be commenced</strong>, and <strong>whether inside or outside Hong Kong</strong>.</p>
<p>However, there are limits: The <strong>arbitral award</strong> must be one that can be <strong>enforced in Hong Kong</strong>—whether under the Arbitration Ordinance or other laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 45(5) of the Arbitration Ordinance</strong><br>In relation to arbitral proceedings which have been or are to be commenced outside Hong Kong, the Court may grant an interim measure under subsection (2) only if—<br>(a) the arbitral proceedings are capable of giving rise to an arbitral award (whether interim or final) that may be enforced in Hong Kong under this Ordinance or any other Ordinance; and<br>(b) the interim measure sought belongs to a type or description of interim measure that may be granted in Hong Kong in relation to arbitral proceedings by the Court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To seek assistance from the Hong Kong courts in aid of arbitration, <strong>two conditions must be satisfied</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The arbitral proceedings must be capable of giving rise to an award that may be enforced under the Arbitration Ordinance or any other ordinance.</li>
<li>The type of interim measure sought must be one that the court itself has jurisdiction to grant.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In simple terms:</strong></p>
<p>You can only ask the Hong Kong courts for help in arbitration matters if the courts already have the power to grant that type of order. It must be a remedy <strong>recognized under Hong Kong law</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if your arbitration is seated in a foreign jurisdiction that recognizes a very unusual type of property transfer, you <strong>cannot</strong> expect the Hong Kong courts to enforce that kind of order if it’s unfamiliar to Hong Kong law.</p>
<p><strong>This is a jurisdictional limitation.</strong></p>
<p>See: Onwel Sales Limited v Sketchers SARL [2021] HKCFI 790 at §16</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Refer to <strong>paragraph 16 of the judgment</strong> to see how real-world facts can limit the seemingly broad scope of court assistance under Section 45.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Onwel Sales case</strong> provides a real-life example of these limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>It involved a dispute between <strong>joint venture parties</strong> concerning the <strong>Sketchers</strong> brand.</li>
<li>Although Section 31 of the Arbitration Ordinance appears to be <strong>very broad</strong>, in practice there are limits.</li>
<li>This case demonstrated that even if arbitration is possible (whether already commenced or contemplated), practical limitations still arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another useful case is the <strong>Minerals case</strong> (2016, 3 HKC 444), decided by <strong>Madam Justice Chan</strong>, who specializes in arbitration matters.</p>
<p>In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Madam Justice Chan laid out a <strong>helpful checklist</strong> for applying Section 45.</li>
<li>It clarifies what courts consider when deciding whether to grant assistance in arbitration-related matters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enforcement mechanisms include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Law Action on the Award</strong>: Recognizing an <strong>implied promise</strong> to perform according to the award (reference to the <em>Eaton</em> case and the Court of Final Appeal’s confirmation of this principle).</li>
<li><strong>Registration of an Award under the Arbitration Ordinance</strong>: A <strong>mechanistic procedure</strong> which, once complete, allows enforcement <strong>as if it were a court judgment</strong>, enabling remedies like <strong>garnishing bank accounts</strong>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition of “Court”:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under <strong>Section 21</strong>, “court” refers to the <strong>Court of First Instance</strong> (i.e., the <strong>High Court</strong>).</li>
<li>Therefore, if seeking an injunction under Section 45, one must apply to the <strong>High Court</strong>, <strong>not</strong> the District Court.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="e-types-of-injunctions">E. Types of Injunctions</span></h3><h4><span id="1-mandatory-injunction">1. Mandatory Injunction</span></h4><p><strong>Definition</strong>: <strong>Mandatory injunctions</strong> compel a party to take <strong>positive action</strong> (e.g., “you must do X”).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: In the context of a shareholders’ agreement, requiring someone to <strong>sign documents</strong> or <strong>execute actions</strong> as stipulated in the agreement.</p>
<p>Courts apply a <strong>higher standard</strong>: The applicant must demonstrate a <strong>strong prima facie case</strong> or provide a <strong>high degree of assurance</strong>.</p>
<p>This higher threshold makes sense: <strong>Imposing positive obligations</strong> is more serious than merely maintaining the status quo.</p>
<h4><span id="2-prohibitory-injunction">2. Prohibitory Injunction</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Prevents someone from doing something.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:<ul>
<li>If a neighbor plays piano at midnight, disturbing your sleep, you might seek a prohibitory injunction based on your right to the <strong>quiet enjoyment</strong> of your home.</li>
<li>Apart from calling the police, you can ask the court for an order <strong>prohibiting</strong> the neighbor from continuing the disturbance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-mareva-x2f-freezing-injunctions">3. Mareva &#x2F; Freezing Injunctions</span></h4><h5><span id="1-what-is-a-mareva-injunction">(1) What is a Mareva Injunction?</span></h5><p>A <strong>Mareva injunction</strong> (named after a shipping case) is the court’s power to <strong>freeze assets</strong> to prevent them from being dissipated before a dispute is resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be granted <strong>before arbitration</strong>, <strong>before litigation</strong>, or <strong>after an award</strong>.</li>
<li>After winning an arbitration, it becomes <strong>easier</strong> to obtain a freezing order because your entitlement has already been confirmed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Court has the power to grant so-called Mareva injunctions freezing a party’s assets when there is a risk of dissipation (Mareva Compania Naviera SA v International Bulkcarriers SA (1975) 2 Lloyd’s Rep 509).</p>
<h5><span id="2-can-be-pre-arbitration-and-post-award">(2) Can be pre-arbitration and post-award</span></h5><p>Applications for a Mareva injunction must be made in a timely manner</p>
<p>Applicant must demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good arguable case on substantive claim;</li>
<li>Assets within the jurisdiction;</li>
<li>Balance of convenience is in favour of grant; and</li>
<li>Real risk of dissipation of assets or removal of assets from the jurisdiction, which would render the plaintiff’s judgment of no effect.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-ex-parte-applications">4. Ex Parte Applications</span></h4><p>When seeking <strong>ex parte</strong> injunctions (i.e., without notifying the other side), there is a <strong>heightened duty</strong> of full and frank disclosure.</p>
<p>Normally, justice systems like Hong Kong’s are <strong>adversarial and open</strong>—both sides appear in court and argue their case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inter partes</strong> proceedings: Both sides are present.</li>
<li><strong>Ex parte</strong> proceedings: Only one party appears without informing the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ex parte applications are <strong>exceptional</strong> and permitted only when <strong>giving notice would cause irreparable harm</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Urgency alone is <strong>not enough</strong> to justify an ex parte application.</li>
<li>Secrecy must be necessary to prevent harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because only one party is present in an ex parte application:</p>
<ul>
<li>That party has a <strong>higher duty</strong> to be <strong>completely honest and transparent</strong>.</li>
<li>This includes disclosing facts and possible defenses that <strong>might harm your case</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>If I go to court alone and accuse someone (say, Duncan) of breaching a contract, I must also inform the court about any possible defense Duncan might raise (e.g., that the contract was forged) — even though that could weaken my case.</p>
<p><strong>If you fail to comply:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The court can set aside your injunction <strong>without even examining the merits</strong> of your case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Breaching the duty of full and frank disclosure is treated <strong>very seriously</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Case Study</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>trade finance dispute</strong> where the applicant sought an ex parte injunction against a supplier and a bank.</li>
<li>Problems:<ul>
<li><strong>No notice</strong> was given to the opposing side when it should have been.</li>
<li>Allegations of <strong>forgery</strong> were <strong>unsupported</strong> or <strong>exaggerated</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Inaccurate or misleading presentation</strong> of facts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The injunction was <strong>barely maintained</strong> for one month.</li>
<li>Applicant was forced to produce an affidavit explaining procedural failures.</li>
<li>Likely significant <strong>cost liabilities</strong> (paying own costs, opponent’s costs, and bank’s costs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Practice Tip</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious: An improperly obtained injunction can <strong>backfire badly</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Always prepare carefully</strong>, especially when making serious allegations (like fraud or forgery).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="5-chabra-jurisdiction-third-party-asset-freezing-orders">5. Chabra Jurisdiction (Third-Party Asset Freezing Orders)</span></h4><p>Chabra jurisdiction – freezing injunction on assets over which Plaintiff has no cause of action – freezing assets held by nominees: Company A v Company D [2018] HKCFI 2240</p>
<p>Under the <em>Chabra</em> jurisdiction, courts can grant injunctions freezing assets held by <strong>third parties</strong> against whom the claimant has <strong>no direct cause of action</strong>, <strong>if</strong> those assets are effectively under the <strong>defendant’s control</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Court orders (such as freezing injunctions) can sometimes bind <strong>third parties</strong> who are <strong>not parties to the arbitration</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is different from tribunal orders, which can only bind parties <strong>to the arbitration agreement</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence showing that the <strong>third party</strong> is <strong>not the true owner</strong> of the asset.</li>
<li>The third party is merely <strong>holding assets as a nominee</strong> for the defendant.</li>
<li><strong>Good reason to suppose</strong> that the assets would be <strong>amenable to execution</strong> of a judgment against the defendant.<ul>
<li>Meaning: After obtaining a judgment, when enforcing it (e.g., garnishing bank accounts, seizing properties), the claimant could reach these assets, even if they are legally owned by another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property legally registered under a third party’s name, but <strong>beneficially owned</strong> or <strong>controlled</strong> by the defendant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>prevent defendants</strong> from shielding their assets by parking them under third-party names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="6-anti-suit-injunctions">6. Anti-Suit Injunctions</span></h4><p>A court order preventing a party from <strong>starting or continuing proceedings</strong> in a different forum (court or arbitration), in breach of an agreement (usually an arbitration agreement).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Basis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom of contract</strong> — parties must <strong>honor the arbitration agreement</strong> they entered into.</li>
<li>Typically sought when a party <strong>breaches an agreement to arbitrate</strong> by initiating court proceedings elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relevant Case</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ever Judger</strong> case, summarized by <strong>Godfrey Lam J</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discretionary remedy</strong>: Granting an anti-suit injunction is not automatic even if there is a breach.</li>
<li><strong>Factors considered</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Delay</strong> in making the application (e.g., if one participates in the foreign proceedings for years before objecting).</li>
<li><strong>Stage of foreign proceedings</strong> (how advanced they are).</li>
<li>The <strong>balance of convenience</strong> and whether granting the injunction would be fair.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parties may apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>to Court to restrain another party from bringing proceedings in other national courts in breach of an arbitration agreement;</li>
<li>to Court to restrain another party from bringing or continuing arbitration proceedings (pursuant to an allegedly invalid arbitration agreement); or</li>
<li>to the Tribunal (once constituted) for an injunction to restrain another party from bringing or continuing competing proceedings in courts in breach of an arbitration agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prevent other parties from commencing or continuing proceedings within the scope of the arbitration agreement in a foreign court.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waiting <strong>five years</strong> after arbitration has commenced abroad before seeking an anti-suit injunction is unlikely to succeed, because parties have invested significant time and costs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="7-quia-timet-injunction">7. Quia Timet Injunction</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Prevents <strong>threatened</strong> or <strong>imminent</strong> harm <strong>before</strong> it occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:<ul>
<li>If directors plan to convene a meeting in breach of a company’s articles of association, and you have credible evidence (such as a circulated notice), you can seek a quia timet injunction to <strong>prevent the meeting from taking place</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(“Quia timet” comes from Latin and refers to relief sought because of a <strong>threat</strong> of a wrongful act.)</p>
<p>⚖️ <strong>Relevant legal principles set out in Ever Judger Holding Co Ltd v Kroman Celik Sanayii Anonim Sirketi [2015] 2 HKLRD 866 §§36-45</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The court should ordinarily grant an injunction to restrain the pursuit of foreign proceedings in breach of an agreement for Hong Kong arbitration, at any rate where the injunction has been sought without delay and the foreign proceedings are not too far advanced, unless the defendant can demonstrate strong reason to the contrary.<br>Whether a party can show strong reasons, sufficient to displace the other party’s prima facie entitlement to enforce the contractual bargain, will depend on all the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</p>

<h4><span id="8-final-vs-interim-interlocutory-injunctions">8. Final vs. Interim (Interlocutory) Injunctions</span></h4><p><strong>Final Injunction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Granted <strong>after a full trial</strong>.</li>
<li>Plaintiff must establish:<ul>
<li>A <strong>cause of action</strong>, and</li>
<li>That <strong>legal rights</strong> have been infringed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>higher threshold</strong> must be met compared to interim relief.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interim (Interlocutory) Injunction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>temporary measure</strong> to preserve the status quo <strong>before trial</strong>.</li>
<li>Does <strong>not</strong> involve full determination of the parties’ substantive rights.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="iv-injunctions-in-contractual-disputes-involving-unique-goods">IV. Injunctions in Contractual Disputes Involving Unique Goods</span></h2><h4><span id="1-damages-may-be-inadequate-due-to-scarcity">1. Damages May Be Inadequate Due to Scarcity</span></h4><p>When a contract concerns a <strong>scarce commodity</strong>, such as a <strong>Ming Dynasty vase</strong>, damages may not be an adequate remedy for breach.</p>
<p>If, at trial, I successfully prove that Duncan breached his contract to sell me the Ming Dynasty vase, merely receiving monetary compensation would not allow me to easily purchase another similar item on the open market — because of the rarity of such goods.</p>
<p>Thus, in these circumstances, a court may be <strong>more inclined to grant an injunction</strong> to <strong>prevent Duncan from selling, disposing of, or otherwise dealing with</strong> the vase while the dispute is being resolved.</p>
<h4><span id="2-balance-of-convenience">2. Balance of Convenience</span></h4><p>The “<strong>balance of convenience</strong>“ is a <strong>discretionary and nebulous</strong> concept.<br> Courts must <strong>weigh up</strong> the relative hardships:</p>
<ul>
<li>If complying with an injunction would be <strong>very difficult</strong> or <strong>onerous</strong> for the respondent, that may weigh <strong>against</strong> granting the injunction.</li>
<li>The court will engage in a practical, case-by-case assessment of what is fair and reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-undertaking-as-to-damages">3. Undertaking as to Damages</span></h4><p>When applying for an injunction, it is <strong>almost always expected</strong> that the applicant must provide an <strong>undertaking to pay damages</strong> if it later turns out that the injunction was wrongfully granted.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose I apply for an injunction claiming Duncan breached our contract over the vase.</li>
<li>The court, without Duncan having had the chance to argue, grants me the injunction — but only <strong>after I provide an undertaking</strong> to pay damages if it turns out the injunction was wrongly obtained.</li>
<li>If, after the trial, it is discovered that <strong>the contract was forged</strong> and Duncan actually suffered significant losses (e.g., he lost a sale opportunity), <strong>I would be liable to compensate Duncan</strong> under my undertaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose is to ensure <strong>fairness</strong>: if the injunction turns out to have been improperly granted, the harmed party (here, Duncan) will still be compensated.</p>
<h4><span id="4-fortification-of-undertaking">4. Fortification of Undertaking</span></h4><p>In some cases, especially where the applicant is a <strong>foreign party without significant local assets</strong>, the court may require <strong>fortification</strong> of the undertaking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fortification</strong> means giving the court — and the opposing party — <strong>assurance</strong> that the undertaking is meaningful.</li>
<li>This could involve:<ul>
<li>Showing proof of ownership of assets (e.g., shares in listed companies), or</li>
<li>Paying a sum of money into court as <strong>security</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to <strong>ensure the applicant can genuinely meet any damages award</strong> if required.</p>
<h2><span id="v-practical-issues">V. Practical Issues</span></h2><h4><span id="1-confidentiality-in-arbitration-related-court-proceedings">1. Confidentiality in Arbitration-Related Court Proceedings</span></h4><p><strong>xample: Binance Case</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A confidential investment negotiation under a <strong>term sheet</strong>.</li>
<li>Applicant breached confidentiality by <strong>not anonymizing</strong> the parties when filing for an injunction.</li>
<li>Result: Public exposure of sensitive information.</li>
<li>Allegation: Applicant deliberately used the court process to cause economic harm (e.g., media reporting an injunction against Binance immediately after it was granted).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When filing court proceedings related to confidential arbitration matters:<ul>
<li><strong>Anonymize</strong> party names if necessary.</li>
<li>Be aware of the risks of <strong>strategic misuse</strong> of injunctions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Provisions below aim to <strong>preserve the confidentiality</strong> traditionally associated with arbitration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 16</strong>:<br> Applications related to arbitration must generally be heard in <strong>closed court</strong> (i.e., not open to the public).</li>
<li><strong>Section 17</strong>:<br> Sets out <strong>reporting restrictions</strong> during closed court proceedings to maintain confidentiality.</li>
<li><strong>Section 18</strong>:<br> <strong>Prohibits disclosure</strong> of information relating to arbitral proceedings or awards <strong>without agreement</strong> between the parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, Sections 16–18 provide the <strong>administrative and practical mechanisms</strong> to ensure the confidential nature of arbitration proceedings is respected even when matters spill over into court.</p>
<h4><span id="2-court-vs-tribunal-applications-for-emergency-relief">2. Court vs Tribunal Applications for Emergency Relief</span></h4><p><strong>Court Applications Advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Courts can hear ex parte applications <strong>within a day</strong> if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Enforceability</strong>: Breach of a court injunction can lead to <strong>contempt of court proceedings</strong> (potential <strong>criminal sanctions</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Emergency situations</strong>: If harm will occur very quickly (e.g., by tomorrow), court is often faster than tribunal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tribunal Applications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful if the tribunal is already constituted and <strong>familiar with the dispute</strong>.</li>
<li>Some rules (e.g., in arbitration) allow emergency arbitrators to grant relief, but may still be slower than court.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consideration of Confidentiality</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to court <strong>may breach confidentiality</strong> obligations under arbitration agreements unless precautions (like anonymization) are taken.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-technical-pitfalls-and-procedural-rigidities">3. Technical Pitfalls and Procedural Rigidities</span></h4><ul>
<li><p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late service</strong> of summons by a few minutes (e.g., 5:33 p.m.) was held insufficient to satisfy the “<strong>two clear days</strong>” rule.</li>
<li>Judge treated it as an <strong>ex parte on notice</strong> application instead of inter partes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Practice Tip</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strict compliance</strong> with procedural rules is critical, especially in injunctions.</li>

<h3><span id="f-should-relief-be-sought-from-the-court">F. Should Relief Be Sought from the Court?</span></h3><h4><span id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</span></h4><p>When deciding whether to seek relief from the court or from an arbitration tribunal, the answer is not straightforward. It depends on the specific circumstances of each case. Here are some factors to consider when evaluating where to seek relief.</p>
<h4><span id="2-power-to-grant-relief-arbitration-vs-court">2. Power to Grant Relief: Arbitration vs. Court</span></h4><p>Most international arbitration rules provide the arbitration tribunal with the power to grant interim measures. For example, under the 2018 Hong Kong Arbitration Rules, Article 23.2 allows either party to request the tribunal to order any measures it deems necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition to the arbitration rules, <strong>national laws</strong> also play a role. The place where the arbitration tribunal is seated (e.g., Hong Kong) will often have its own legal provisions that can impact the availability of relief. The Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance, under Article 17 of the Model Law, permits the tribunal to grant interim measures unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>
<p>While the tribunal generally has the power to grant interim measures, there are cases where the <strong>court</strong> might be the better option.</p>
<h4><span id="3-when-might-you-need-to-seek-court-relief">3. When Might You Need to Seek Court Relief?</span></h4><p>Here are a few reasons why one might consider seeking relief from the court rather than from the tribunal:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Enforcement Power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A tribunal’s order may lack the enforcement strength that a court order has. For example, if a tribunal issues an order and the counterparty fails to comply, there are fewer sanctions or legal consequences compared to a court order, which could be backed by penalties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enforceability Issues in Jurisdiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if an interim order is issued by the tribunal, it may not be enforceable in the jurisdiction where you need it to take effect. For example, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) may issue an order, but if the counterparty’s assets are in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the tribunal’s order, it may be ineffective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tribunal’s Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some orders simply fall outside the tribunal’s scope. For example, certain types of orders, like a <strong>search and seize order</strong> (where you are allowed to enter a location and seize evidence), may be beyond the tribunal’s authority. In these cases, you might need to approach the court, which may have the power to issue such orders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Party-Application Restrictions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitration tribunals might not allow certain types of applications. For instance, some tribunals may not allow an application to surprise the other side with an order before they can react. In such cases, seeking court intervention may be necessary to gain an advantage in the proceedings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Jurisdiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitration is a consensual process. The tribunal can only issue orders related to the parties that are bound by the arbitration agreement. If the subject of the dispute involves third parties not bound by the arbitration agreement, the tribunal may not have the jurisdiction to issue an order regarding those parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in a recent matter involving battery units in the United States, our client had sold these units to customers. The dispute concerned whether the batteries were faulty. The opponent wanted to apply to the tribunal for jurisdiction over these units in the hands of the customers. However, the tribunal had no jurisdiction over the customers because they were not parties to the arbitration agreement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Urgency and Speed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency situations may require faster action than the arbitration process can provide. For example, an emergency arbitrator under the ICC, CAC, or HKIAC rules might take <strong>14 to 15 days</strong> to render an order. In urgent cases, this delay could be too long, especially if you need immediate relief.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>court</strong> can often act much faster. For example, if there is an emergency, the court might be able to issue an order on the same day, whereas the arbitration process might take significantly longer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><span id="4-conclusion-when-to-go-to-court">4. Conclusion: When to Go to Court</span></h4><p>The decision to seek relief from the court or the tribunal depends on various factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urgency</strong>: If immediate relief is necessary, the court may be the better option.</li>
<li><strong>Enforceability</strong>: If the tribunal’s order may not be enforceable in the relevant jurisdiction, the court could provide stronger support.</li>
<li><strong>Scope and Limitations</strong>: If the tribunal cannot grant the necessary order due to jurisdictional or procedural limitations, the court may be the only option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the choice should be made based on the specific needs and context of your case.</p>
<h3><span id="g-why-choose-court-relief-over-tribunal-relief">G. Why Choose Court Relief Over Tribunal Relief?</span></h3><h4><span id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</span></h4><p>While courts offer many advantages when seeking interim measures, there are important considerations that may make arbitration preferable in certain situations. Let’s explore why, despite the benefits of court orders, you might still choose to go before an arbitration tribunal.</p>
<h4><span id="2-arbitration-vs-court-the-rules-you-operate-under">2. Arbitration vs. Court: The Rules You Operate Under</span></h4><p>In most international arbitration frameworks, there are provisions that allow for interim relief through national courts. These rules generally recognize the possibility of seeking interim relief from courts in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ICC Rules</strong> allow for court applications before arbitration begins, but the circumstances under which you can do so are subject to interpretation. What constitutes “appropriate circumstances” may vary, and disagreements can arise between the parties.</li>
<li><strong>LCIA Rules</strong> similarly provide for court applications, but only in <strong>exceptional cases</strong> and with the <strong>tribunal’s permission</strong>. This adds an extra layer of complexity, as the tribunal’s authorization is required, which might lead to challenges in maintaining surprise or urgency.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-why-not-always-go-to-court">3. Why Not Always Go to Court?</span></h4><p>If there are clear advantages to going to court, why would one still seek relief from the tribunal? Here are some factors to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surprise Factor and Speed</strong>:<ul>
<li>Going to court can sometimes alert the other party prematurely, which may undermine the strategic advantage of surprise. In contrast, tribunals can be more flexible and, in some cases, less formal, which may be crucial for urgent matters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tribunal’s Familiarity and Procedural Flexibility</strong>:<ul>
<li>Tribunals are familiar with the arbitration process and may offer more streamlined, specialized relief tailored to the needs of the case, compared to the sometimes rigid approach of national courts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdictional Considerations</strong>:<ul>
<li>When seeking relief from the court, you must also consider the jurisdiction in which the court is located. This can create complications if the assets or parties involved are not within that jurisdiction. For example, a <strong>Hong Kong court</strong> order may not be effective against assets in <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>. In this case, seeking relief from a Saudi Arabian court might be more effective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><span id="4-key-rules-to-be-aware-of">4. Key Rules to Be Aware Of</span></h4><ol>
<li><strong>ICC Rules</strong>:<ul>
<li>According to the ICC rules, before the arbitration is transmitted to the tribunal, parties may apply for interim measures to any competent judicial authority. However, the interpretation of <strong>“appropriate circumstances”</strong> can vary and is not always clearly defined. Caution is needed when making a court application in such circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>LCIA Rules</strong>:<ul>
<li>The LCIA rules provide that the tribunal’s power to issue interim measures does not prejudice a party’s right to approach a state court. However, this right is contingent on <strong>exceptional circumstances</strong> and <strong>tribunal authorization</strong>. This means that after the tribunal is formed, parties generally need to seek permission from the tribunal to apply to the court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>National Court Jurisdiction</strong>:<ul>
<li>Different jurisdictions have different attitudes towards enforcement. In <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, the law permits courts to provide interim measures alongside arbitration proceedings, without conflicting with the arbitration agreement. However, if the order is made in Hong Kong, its enforcement may be limited to Hong Kong’s jurisdiction. In cases involving cross-border issues (e.g., freezing orders on bank accounts in Saudi Arabia), the efficacy of the Hong Kong court order may be limited without cooperation from local authorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><span id="5-strategic-considerations-tribunal-vs-court">5. Strategic Considerations: Tribunal vs. Court</span></h4><p>The decision to go to court or to the tribunal isn’t always clear-cut:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Court vs. Court</strong>: If assets or parties are located in multiple jurisdictions, the decision could involve multiple courts, making the process more complex. The choice may not be simply between the tribunal and one court, but between different national courts based on the enforcement and jurisdictional rules in each.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Considerations</strong>: If urgent relief is needed and a tribunal cannot act quickly enough, seeking interim measures from the court may be necessary. However, if the tribunal is already engaged, it may be more efficient to work within its framework to avoid complications or delays.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</span></h4><p>Choosing whether to go to the tribunal or the court for interim relief depends on various factors, including jurisdiction, urgency, and the specific rules governing the arbitration process. While courts offer powerful enforcement, tribunals may offer quicker, more specialized relief, especially if you can keep the proceedings confidential or surprise the opposing party. It’s essential to balance these considerations based on the specific circumstances of your case.</p>
<h2><span id="ii-if-a-court-which-court">II. If a court, which court?</span></h2><h3><span id="a-hong-kong">A. Hong Kong</span></h3><p>Interim measures are also available from the Hong Kong courts in support of arbitration.</p>
<p>The Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) makes it clear that the jurisdiction of the courts to grant interim measures exists in addition to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and requesting such measures from court does not invalidate the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>Section 21 of the Arbitration Ordinance (Art. 9 UNCITRAL Model Law) (Arbitration agreement and interim measures by court):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an interim measure of protection and for a court to grant such measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="b-overseas-arbitrations">B. Overseas arbitrations</span></h3><p>The availability of interim measures before the Hong Kong courts extends to arbitrations taking place outside of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Section 45(2) of the Arbitration Ordinance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the application of any party, the Court may, in relation to any arbitral proceedings which have been or are to be commenced in or outside Hong Kong, grant an interim measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 17J of Model Law</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A court shall have the same power of issuing an interim measure in relation to arbitration proceedings, irrespective of whether their place is in the territory of this State, as it has in relation to proceedings in courts.  The court shall exercise such power in accordance with its own procedures in consideration of the specific features of international arbitration</p>

<h4><span id="1-challenges-in-seeking-court-orders-in-different-jurisdictions">1. Challenges in Seeking Court Orders in Different Jurisdictions</span></h4><p>The choice of jurisdiction is crucial when seeking interim measures, especially in cases where the arbitration is seated in one country, but you need to seek relief in another jurisdiction. The relationship between the arbitration and the location of the relief needed can create complications.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hong Kong Example</strong>:<ul>
<li>Hong Kong law provides permissive language (Section 452 of the Arbitration Ordinance) that allows the Hong Kong courts to issue interim measures for arbitrations seated elsewhere, like in LCIA arbitration.</li>
<li>This is beneficial if you want to obtain relief in Hong Kong, even though the arbitration itself is seated elsewhere. However, this permissive language is not universally available in all jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Irish Example</strong>:<ul>
<li>In a case involving Ireland, the question arose whether Irish courts would grant interim measures in support of a <strong>seat of arbitration</strong> located elsewhere.</li>
<li>The situation was unclear, and whether relief could be granted before the arbitration was even initiated remained ambiguous. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific legal environment of the jurisdiction involved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PRC Example</strong>:<ul>
<li>The <strong>People’s Republic of China</strong> (PRC) provides another challenge. The PRC will only entertain an application for interim relief if the arbitration is seated in Hong Kong. This illustrates how certain jurisdictions may only support measures when the arbitration is conducted under specific conditions (such as Hong Kong’s status as the seat of arbitration).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><span id="2-global-support-for-interim-measures-the-model-law">2. Global Support for Interim Measures: The Model Law</span></h4><p>The <strong>UNCITRAL Model Law</strong> (Article 17J) plays a significant role in jurisdictions that have adopted it. It grants courts the same powers to issue interim measures as they would in domestic proceedings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Countries that support interim measures under the Model Law</strong>:<ul>
<li>Jurisdictions such as <strong>Australia</strong>, <strong>New Zealand</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, and others that have adopted the Model Law are generally more permissive about granting interim relief in support of international arbitration.</li>
<li>However, the effectiveness of interim relief is still jurisdiction-specific. Even within Model Law jurisdictions, local legal advice is essential to understand the full scope of what is possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-jurisdictions-with-ambiguities-or-restrictions">3. Jurisdictions with Ambiguities or Restrictions</span></h4><p>Some jurisdictions, such as <strong>England and Wales</strong>, have more restrictive conditions regarding interim measures.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>England and Wales</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Section 43(3) of the Arbitration Act</strong> allows the court to issue orders to preserve evidence in arbitration-related matters, but this is not the same as the Model Law’s broad approach.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Section 44 Arbitration Act 1996 (England &amp; Wales)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s. 44(3) </p>
<p>If the case is one of urgency, the court may, on the application of a party or proposed party to the arbitral proceedings, make such orders as it thinks necessary for the purpose of preserving evidence or assets.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Section 44(4)</strong> further restricts the circumstances under which court orders can be sought. If the matter is not urgent, permission from the tribunal is required, or the consent of the other parties is needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s. 44(4) </p>
<p>If the case is not one of urgency, the court shall act only on the application of a party to the arbitral proceedings (upon notice to the other parties and to the tribunal) made with the permission of the tribunal or the agreement in writing of the other parties.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>In practice, obtaining the consent of the opposing party can be nearly impossible, as they are typically the target of the relief. Hence, permission from the tribunal becomes crucial.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Courts may be reluctant to grant relief without urgency, which is often subjective. What one party considers urgent, the court might not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="4-practical-considerations-for-seeking-court-orders">4. Practical Considerations for Seeking Court Orders</span></h4><ol>
<li><strong>Urgency</strong>:<ul>
<li>Urgency plays a key role in determining whether a court will issue interim measures. However, urgency is often subjective, and it may be compared to how quickly a tribunal could act.</li>
<li>If the tribunal can act more quickly than the court, the party seeking relief may need to reconsider whether court intervention is necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Perception by the Tribunal</strong>:<ul>
<li>Seeking interim relief from a court instead of the tribunal may negatively affect the tribunal’s view of the party’s commitment to arbitration. This could be perceived as bypassing the tribunal and could potentially harm the party’s position.</li>

<h2><span id="iii-considerations-for-choosing-court-vs-tribunal-relief">III. Considerations for Choosing Court vs. Tribunal Relief</span></h2><h3><span id="a-key-considerations-for-seeking-relief-in-court">A. Key Considerations for Seeking Relief in Court</span></h3><p>When considering whether to seek relief from a tribunal or a court, several factors must be considered, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction of the Court</strong>:<ul>
<li>You must consider the relevant law of the jurisdiction where the court is located. This could be the law of the country where the arbitration is happening, or it could be the law of a third-party country.</li>
<li>The court must accept jurisdiction based on the arbitration agreement, and you’ll need to follow the <strong>civil procedure rules</strong> in that jurisdiction for how applications are made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Binding Power</strong>:<ul>
<li>One significant advantage of seeking relief from a court is its <strong>binding power</strong>, which extends not just to the parties involved in the arbitration, but potentially to third parties as well.</li>
<li>Courts can also issue <strong>injunctions</strong>, and other specific interim measures that may be difficult to obtain from a tribunal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Relief</strong>:<ul>
<li>Courts can often provide emergency relief more quickly than tribunals. Examples of this include <strong>freezing orders</strong> or <strong>injunctions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><span id="b-tribunal-relief-a-different-approach">B. Tribunal Relief: A Different Approach</span></h3><p>While tribunals can provide relief, especially under institutional rules, there are some limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speed of Relief</strong>:<ul>
<li>Tribunals may not always be able to act as quickly as courts, particularly in emergency situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<ul>
<li>One key advantage of going before a tribunal is that arbitration proceedings are typically <strong>confidential</strong>. If confidentiality is a critical factor, the tribunal may be the preferred venue for interim relief.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tribunal vs. Court After the Tribunal is Established</strong>:<ul>
<li>Once the tribunal is up and running, seeking relief from the tribunal might be more straightforward. However, obtaining relief from a court might become more difficult, especially if the tribunal is already in the process of handling the case.</li>
<li><strong>Court reluctance</strong> may also arise if the arbitration has already commenced, and the matter could be handled by the tribunal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="iv-interim-measures-of-protection">IV. Interim Measures of Protection</span></h2><h3><span id="a-interim-measures-of-protection">A. Interim Measures of Protection</span></h3><p>Under the Arbitration Ordinance, the following interim measures of protection are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>the preservation, custody or sale of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>the inspection, photographing, preservation or detention of “relevant” property subject to the arbitration: ss.56(1)(d)(i), 56(6), 60(1)(a) and 60(2) AO;</li>
<li>directing samples to be taken from, observations to be made of, or experiments to be conducted on “relevant” property: ss.56(1)(d)(ii), 56(6), 60(1)(b) and 60(2) AO; and</li>
<li>interim injunctions or other interim measures of protection (ss.35 and 45 AO).</li>
</ul>
<p>These powers are vested in the arbitral tribunal. However, for some of these measures there is concurrent power of the courts (ss. 45, 60(1), (3), (4)).</p>
<p>Where a party’s claim is for the enforcement of rights to property, the Tribunal can make an order under ss.56(1)(d) or 60(1)(a) AO.</p>
<p>To make an order under s.56(1)(d) the “relevant” property must be owned by or be in the possession of a party to the arbitral proceedings and not in the possession or custody of a third party.</p>
<p>If the property is in the custody of a third party, application should be made to the court under s.60(1).</p>
<p>When a court makes an order under s.60(1)(a), it is the Tribunal, party or expert that executes the order (at the court’s “direction”).</p>
<p>An order under ss.56(1)(d) or 60(1)(a) may be made together with an interlocutory injunction ordered under ss.35 or 45 AO.</p>

Tribunal Powers in Arbitration: Preservation of Property</span></h3><h4><span id="1-objective-of-arbitration-empowering-the-tribunal">1. Objective of Arbitration: Empowering the Tribunal</span></h4><p>One of the primary objectives of arbitration is to vest as much authority as possible in the arbitral tribunal, while limiting the need for recourse to the courts. This underlying principle is reflected in various sections of arbitration legislation.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Section 56(1)</strong>, the tribunal’s powers are defined, but they remain subject to any contrary agreement made between the parties through their arbitration agreement. In contrast, the powers of the courts are not subject to such restrictions, meaning there is no equivalent limitation on court jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When considering the powers available, it is important to understand which powers are <strong>concurrent</strong> between the tribunal and the court, and which are not.</p>
<h4><span id="2-preservation-measures-tribunal-vs-court">2. Preservation Measures: Tribunal vs. Court</span></h4><p>Moving forward, we discuss measures available to preserve property in arbitration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 56</strong> outlines the powers of the tribunal.</li>
<li><strong>Section 6</strong> defines the powers of the court.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Section 56, the tribunal’s powers to preserve property are limited to situations where the relevant property is either owned by, or in the possession of, a party to the arbitration.</p>
<p>In contrast, the court’s jurisdiction under Section 6 is broader: it allows the court to grant injunctions even over assets held by third parties who are not directly involved in the arbitration.</p>
<p>Thus, when a court orders the preservation of property, it is still the tribunal that ultimately <strong>executes</strong> the order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>📌 <strong>Key Difference</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>court order</strong> requires execution through the tribunal.</li>
<li>A <strong>tribunal order</strong> does <strong>not</strong> require separate execution.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><span id="3-concurrent-jurisdiction-and-conditions">3. Concurrent Jurisdiction and Conditions</span></h4><p>The powers to preserve property can be exercised <strong>concurrently</strong> under Sections 56 and 164. However, two conditions must be satisfied for the tribunal to exercise such powers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The property must be <strong>in the possession of a party</strong> to the arbitration.</li>
<li>The property must have a <strong>connection with the subject matter</strong> of the arbitration proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Merely having some relationship with the proceedings is <strong>not sufficient</strong> to trigger these preservation powers.</p>
<h3><span id="c-measures-to-preserve-evidence">C. Measures to Preserve Evidence</span></h3><h4><span id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</span></h4><p>The Tribunal may make orders for the inspection, photographing, preservation or detention of “relevant” property (s.56(1)(d)(i) AO). It may also make orders directing samples to be taken from, observations to be made of, or experiments to be conducted on “relevant” property (s.56(1)(d)(ii) AO).</p>
<p>These powers of the Tribunal are aimed at preserving property as evidence or facilitating the process of obtaining evidence.</p>
<p>Orders made under s.56(1)(d) may be enforced in court (s.61 AO).</p>
<p>Where an order has to be enforceable against a third party, applications have to be made to court under s.60(1).</p>
<p>Example of the wide reaching powers of court: Anton Piller orders (O.29 &#x2F; PD 11.2 with PD 11.1 (ex parte application)):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Anton Piller order is a court order that provides the right to search premises and seize evidence (without warning to the counterparty) in order to prevent destruction of relevant evidence. Court’s powers are developed out of trademark, copyright or patent infringements cases but are now applied more widely.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span id="2-taking-evidence-and-search-orders">2. Taking Evidence and Search Orders</span></h4><p>An important tool related to the preservation of evidence is the <strong>search order</strong>, available under both Section 56 and Section 6.</p>
<p>Recall from last week: a search order allows one party (usually through solicitors) to enter the premises of the opposing party—commercial or domestic—to search for and secure relevant documents or property.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such an order may be necessary if there is reason to believe that:<ul>
<li>The respondent holds documents or property relevant to the arbitration.</li>
<li>There is a risk that the respondent may destroy or conceal such documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This remedy is particularly powerful: it allows one party in civil proceedings to search the other party’s computers, premises, and documents to preserve vital evidence.</p>
<h4><span id="3-rationale-behind-search-orders">3. Rationale Behind Search Orders</span></h4><p>The very nature of a search order is that <strong>prior notice</strong> would defeat its purpose. If the opposing party is alerted to the order, they might immediately destroy or hide the evidence.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might suspect that a warehouse contains counterfeit goods infringing your intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>If you warned the opponent, they might quickly destroy the goods before you can collect evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search orders are therefore especially critical in cases involving intellectual property infringement but are <strong>not limited</strong> to IP cases.</p>
<p>They can also be used in <strong>commercial disputes</strong>, for instance where:</p>
<ul>
<li>A party is withholding sensitive trade information.</li>
<li>A party refuses to return important documents belonging to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="v-security-for-costs">V. Security for Costs</span></h2><h3><span id="a-what-is-security-for-costs">A. What is Security for costs?</span></h3><h4><span id="1-overview">1. Overview</span></h4><p><strong>Security for costs</strong> refers to the power of the arbitral tribunal to order that the claimant (or counterclaiming respondent) shall provide adequate security for any costs which may be awarded against him in the event of a dismissal of his claim or counterclaim.</p>
<p>It is intended to ensure that the respondent (usually the party defending the arbitration) does not face financial loss in case the claimant’s case is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In litigation or arbitration, a defendant who successfully defends against an unmeritorious claim may be awarded legal costs. However, there’s a risk that the claimant may not have the assets to pay these costs, even if they lose. The concept of <strong>security for costs</strong> helps mitigate this risk by requiring the claimant to provide a form of financial guarantee to cover potential legal costs. This ensures that if the defendant wins, they are more likely to recover their costs without having to chase after the claimant for payment.</p>
<h4><span id="2-why-security-for-costs-is-important">2. Why Security for Costs Is Important?</span></h4><p>In a litigation context, security for costs is often necessary when the claimant’s ability to pay is uncertain. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a claimant is based in a jurisdiction where assets are hard to access or enforce against (e.g., a Cayman-based company), the court may require the claimant to provide security for costs. This guarantees that if the defendant wins, they will be able to recover the costs of defending the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>arbitration</strong>, the situation is slightly different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitration is a consensual process, meaning both parties have voluntarily agreed to arbitrate their dispute. Thus, the location of the opposing party is often less relevant, as arbitration agreements typically specify where proceedings will take place.</li>
<li>The primary concern in arbitration is ensuring that if a cost award is granted, the successful party can recover those costs, especially when the losing party’s financial capacity is uncertain.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-what-is-the-position-at-common-law">3. What is the position at common law?</span></h4><p>This concept originates from <strong>common law</strong> systems, where the general rule is that <strong>costs follow the event</strong>—the losing party is usually required to pay the legal costs of the winning party.</p>
<p>In many common law jurisdictions (like <strong>England</strong> or <strong>Hong Kong</strong>), if a party wins the case, they can expect not only to have their legal costs covered, but also potentially to be awarded the legal fees of the other party.</p>
<h4><span id="4-why-does-the-security-for-costs-rule-exist">4. Why Does the Security for Costs Rule Exist?</span></h4><p>The rule of security for costs primarily exists to protect respondents from the financial burden of defending against a claim, especially when the claimant is unlikely to be able to cover the costs if the claim is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Without this provision, a respondent could face the risk of not only paying their own legal fees but also being required to cover the legal fees of the claimant, should the claimant lose.</p>
<h4><span id="5-common-law-vs-civil-law">5. Common Law vs. Civil Law</span></h4><p>In <strong>common law</strong> systems, the concept of costs following the event is generally applied, making the issue of <strong>security for costs</strong> more relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Civil law</strong> systems, however, may not have the same automatic expectation of costs following the event, but security for costs can still be applied under specific circumstances, depending on the arbitration rules and local laws.</p>
<h4><span id="6-comparison-between-court-proceedings-and-arbitration-regarding-security-for-costs">6. Comparison between Court Proceedings and Arbitration Regarding Security for Costs</span></h4><p>Under <strong>Section 95</strong> of the relevant legislation in Hong Kong:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>court may order security for costs</strong> whether the party is a <strong>limited company incorporated in Hong Kong</strong> or a <strong>foreign company</strong> incorporated <strong>outside Hong Kong</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Credible testimony</strong> (i.e., credible evidence) must show that there is a <strong>reason to believe</strong> the claimant would be <strong>unable to pay the defendant’s costs</strong> if ordered to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key comparison</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In court proceedings</strong>, the fact that a company is a <strong>foreign entity</strong> can be a <strong>strong reason</strong> for ordering security for costs.</li>
<li><strong>In arbitration</strong>, however, the mere fact that a company is foreign <strong>should not by itself</strong> be sufficient to justify an order for security.</li>
<li>This reflects a <strong>higher threshold</strong> for obtaining security for costs in arbitration compared to court litigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="7-application-in-arbitration">7. Application in Arbitration</span></h4><p>In arbitration, a tribunal can order the claimant to provide <strong>security for costs</strong> at the outset of the case or during the proceedings if there is a concern that the claimant may not be able to pay costs if the case is dismissed.</p>
<p>This typically happens if there is doubt about the claimant’s ability to cover the financial consequences of an adverse decision, such as in cases where the claimant is not domiciled in the jurisdiction of the arbitration or has limited assets.</p>
<p>Although the concept of security for costs operates similarly to litigation, but with some key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction and Location</strong>: Unlike in court, where jurisdiction plays a significant role in determining where you can enforce orders, in arbitration, both parties typically know where their assets are located and where the proceedings will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Measure</strong>: Security for costs is often considered a defensive measure, protecting a defendant from the financial burden of an unmeritorious claim. It’s a way of ensuring that costs are covered upfront, rather than the defendant having to chase the claimant after the arbitration concludes.</li>

<h3><span id="b-questions-for-the-arbitrator-to-ask">B. Questions for the arbitrator to ask:</span></h3><ul>
<li>Do I have the power? If yes, is this a discretionary power?</li>
<li>How should I exercise my discretion?</li>
<li>What is the quantum of costs that I should order?</li>
<li>In what form should security be given?</li>
<li>What are the consequences for non-compliance?</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="c-do-i-have-the-power">C. Do I have the power?</span></h3><p><strong>First question</strong>: <em>Do I (as the arbitrator) have the power to grant security for costs?</em></p>
<p><strong>Legal Basis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Hong Kong, the legal authority arises from <strong>Section 56(1)(a) of the Arbitration Ordinance</strong>.</li>
<li>This section provides that, <em>unless otherwise agreed by the parties</em>, the tribunal may make an order requiring:<ul>
<li>A claimant, or</li>
<li>A respondent (in the context of a counterclaim)</li>
<li><strong>to give security for costs</strong> in the arbitration proceedings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>s.56(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, when conducting arbitral proceedings, an arbitral tribunal may make an order—<br>(a) requiring a claimant to give security for the costs of the arbitration…”<br>A negative stipulation under s.56(2)<br>“(2) An arbitral tribunal must not make an order under subsection (1)(a) only on the ground that the claimant is—<br>(a) a natural person who is ordinarily resident outside Hong Kong;<br>(b) a body corporate—<br>(i) incorporated under the law of a place outside Hong Kong; or<br>(ii) the central management and control of which is exercised outside Hong Kong; or<br>(c) an association—<br>(i) formed under the law of a place outside Hong Kong; or<br>(ii) the central management and control of which is exercised outside Hong Kong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a statutory or contractual basis, the tribunal cannot grant such an order.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, since the Arbitration Ordinance provides for this power, security for costs applications are permissible.</p>
<h3><span id="d-how-can-i-exercise-such-power">D. How can I exercise such power?</span></h3><h4><span id="1-discretionary-nature-of-security-for-costs">1. Discretionary Nature of Security for Costs</span></h4><p>The tribunal’s <strong>power to order security for costs</strong> under Section 56(1)(a) of the Arbitration Ordinance is <strong>discretionary</strong>, not mandatory.</p>
<p>Therefore, in <strong>each case</strong>, the tribunal must <strong>evaluate whether it is appropriate</strong> to grant security.</p>
<h4><span id="2-tribunals-thought-process">2. Tribunal’s Thought Process</span></h4><p>When sitting as an arbitrator, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whether to exercise discretion</strong> to grant security at all.</li>
<li><strong>If yes</strong>, then <strong>how to determine the appropriate quantum</strong> (i.e., amount) of security.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-exercising-discretion-statutory-framework">3. Exercising Discretion: Statutory Framework</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Section 56(2) of the Arbitration Ordinance</strong> provides <strong>limitations</strong> on how discretion can be exercised:<ul>
<li>It <strong>prohibits</strong> tribunals from ordering security for costs <em>solely</em> because:<ul>
<li>The claimant is <strong>resident outside Hong Kong</strong>.</li>
<li>The claimant is a <strong>foreign company</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, <strong>foreign status alone is not sufficient</strong> to justify security for costs under Hong Kong law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Policy reason</strong>:<ul>
<li>To avoid discrimination against foreign parties and to <strong>support the neutrality</strong> of Hong Kong as an arbitration seat.</li>

<li><strong>Out of Jurisdiction</strong>:<ul>
<li>Not only is the claimant outside Hong Kong, but the <strong>difficulty of enforcement</strong> in their jurisdiction may also be a factor.</li>
<li>For example:<ul>
<li>A jurisdiction <strong>not a New York Convention party</strong>.</li>
<li>A jurisdiction where enforcement would be <strong>very difficult or uncertain</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Security</strong>:<ul>
<li>Arbitration allows <strong>more flexibility</strong> compared to court proceedings.<ul>
<li>Traditional court practice: <strong>Cash deposit</strong> into a controlled account.</li>
<li>Arbitration options:<ul>
<li><strong>Bank guarantee</strong> instead of cash.</li>
<li>Other forms depending on the case and tribunal discretion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Security</strong>:<ul>
<li>A <strong>high-quality guarantee</strong> (e.g., from HSBC or a reputable Hong Kong bank) is almost as good as cash.</li>
<li><strong>Weaker guarantees</strong>:<ul>
<li>Guarantees from banks in less stable jurisdictions or smaller banks might be insufficient.</li>
<li>Tribunal must assess the <strong>solvency and credibility</strong> of the guarantor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risks in Requiring Security</strong>:<ul>
<li>If the security provided fails later, the arbitration could be <strong>derailed unfairly</strong>.</li>
<li>Equally, if no security is provided, the respondent could be <strong>exposed to unrecoverable costs</strong> even if they win.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing fairness</strong> to both parties is key.</li>

<h4><span id="4-checklist">4. Checklist</span></h4><ul>
<li><p>Not to be used as an instrument of oppression. </p>
<p>Tribunal must guard against security applications used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oppressively</strong> to burden or exhaust the claimant.</li>
<li><strong>Tactically</strong> to block a meritorious claim.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Not to stifle a genuine claim.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not to be used as a tactical device to intimidate a weaker party or delay the hearing on substantive issues.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be made as early as possible in the proceedings. </p>
<p>Technically, security can be applied for <strong>at any time</strong> during proceedings.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earlier applications</strong> are generally seen as more bona fide.</li>
<li><strong>Late applications</strong> could be perceived as <strong>tactical</strong> (e.g., to disrupt or delay the proceedings).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unreasonable delay is an important factor against the making of an order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not to go into the merits in more details than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>While merits can be considered, the tribunal must avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conducting a detailed inquiry</strong> into the merits at this stage.</li>
<li>Turning the interlocutory application into a <strong>mini-trial</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Merits consideration should only arise if there is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear and obvious weakness</strong> in the claim.</li>
<li>Not when the case depends on substantial disputed facts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A balance of competing interest between the interest of preventing one party from getting an empty award and that of stifling a bona fide claim.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>S.905 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.622)</strong><br>The Court may order security where (i) the plaintiff is a limited company or a company incorporated outside Hong Kong and (ii) by credible testimony there is reason to believe that the plaintiff will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if the defendant succeeds in the defence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span id="2-grounds-for-granting-security-beyond-foreign-residence">2. Grounds for Granting Security: Beyond Foreign Residence</span></h4><p><strong>More compelling reasons are required</strong>, depending on the facts of the case.</p>
<p>Possible grounds could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial difficulties</strong>:<ul>
<li>Evidence of a <strong>deterioration in financial position</strong> since the arbitration agreement was made.</li>
<li>Concern that the claimant might <strong>not be able to pay</strong> the respondent’s legal costs if the claim fails.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk of non-payment</strong>:<ul>
<li>Proof that the claimant has <strong>no substantial assets</strong> within the jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Terms of the arbitration agreement</strong>:<ul>
<li>Clauses that imply or require that parties must be <strong>financially sound</strong> or must <strong>provide security</strong> under certain conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Tip</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When making an application, you should <strong>identify multiple reasons</strong> (perhaps <strong>five or six</strong>) to support the request for security.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>multi-pronged strategy</strong>:<ul>
<li>Financial insolvency.</li>
<li>Lack of local assets.</li>
<li>Deterioration of financial status.</li>
<li>Terms of the arbitration agreement.</li>
<li>Any delay or bad faith conduct by the claimant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="f-how-to-determine-the-quantum-of-costs">F.  How to determine the quantum of costs?</span></h3><p>The arbitrator must act judicially in fixing the amount.</p>
<p>Figures must not be nominal, nor on a full indemnity basis – should be assessed on a party and party basis.</p>
<p>“Sufficient” security does not mean “complete” security.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantum is generally the easier aspect</strong> to approach first.</li>
<li><strong>Key considerations</strong>:<ul>
<li>Should security cover <strong>the entirety of the respondent’s expected legal costs</strong>?</li>
<li>From the <strong>defendant’s perspective</strong>:<ul>
<li>It is preferable to seek <strong>as much security as possible</strong> to:<ul>
<li>Ensure full recovery of legal costs if successful.</li>
<li><strong>Increase the financial pressure</strong> on the claimant.</li>
<li>Argue that the claim will involve complex and costly litigation to justify a higher security amount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>From the tribunal’s perspective</strong>:<ul>
<li>A <strong>stage-by-stage approach</strong> might be fairer:<ul>
<li>Order security for <strong>early stages</strong> first (e.g., statement of case and defense).</li>
<li>Later stages (e.g., document production, hearing) could trigger <strong>further security orders</strong> if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This staged approach:<ul>
<li>Avoids <strong>overburdening</strong> the claimant.</li>
<li>Ensures that security remains <strong>proportionate</strong> and <strong>responsive</strong> to the progress of the arbitration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <strong>rare</strong> for a tribunal (or court) to order that the <strong>full legal costs</strong> be <strong>totally</strong> (i.e., dollar-for-dollar or pound-for-pound) recovered. For example, if a party believes that the litigation could cost <strong>USD 1 million</strong>, it is <strong>unlikely</strong> that they would be able to recover <strong>100%</strong> of that amount.</p>
<p><strong>More commonly</strong>, courts and tribunals will award <strong>“reasonable costs”</strong>, which typically represent about <strong>50–60%</strong> of the <strong>actual costs incurred</strong>.</p>
<p>Consequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of <strong>security for costs ordered</strong> should also <strong>not</strong> be calculated on a full indemnity (dollar-for-dollar) basis.</li>
<li>Instead, it should reflect <strong>what is reasonably recoverable</strong>, meaning <strong>a lower amount</strong> than the full legal costs incurred.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="g-in-what-form-should-security-be-given">G. In what form should security be given?</span></h3><p>Different <strong>forms of security</strong> can be ordered (e.g., bank guarantees, payment into escrow or court, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Consequences for non-compliance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a party <strong>fails</strong> to comply with a security for costs order, the tribunal can:<ul>
<li><strong>Stay</strong> the claim (i.e., temporarily halt the proceedings), or</li>
<li><strong>Dismiss</strong> the claim altogether.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>However</strong>, from a <strong>practical perspective</strong>, tribunals are <strong>reluctant</strong> to dismiss claims purely for failure to comply with a security for costs order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why?</strong><ul>
<li>The fundamental purpose of arbitration is for parties to <strong>have their disputes resolved</strong>.</li>
<li>Because <strong>security for costs should be harder to obtain in arbitration</strong> than in court, dismissing a claim solely on this ground would be a <strong>drastic step</strong> and generally <strong>unusual</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore</strong>, a <strong>stay</strong> is generally preferred over dismissal.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="h-what-are-the-consequences-for-non-compliance">H. What are the consequences for non-compliance?</span></h3><p>Imagine the client is <strong>currently involved</strong> in applications where the applicant does not pay security because the company is <strong>essentially already not a going concern</strong> (i.e., not operating properly as a business).</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> to apply for security?</p>
<p>Dismissal vs Stay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, <strong>stay</strong> is more appropriate if the concern is <strong>holding the line</strong> while waiting for security to be provided.</li>
<li><strong>Dismissal</strong> may be more appropriate in specific cases such as <strong>cancellation of stock exchange listings</strong>, where:<ul>
<li>The companies often argue that they have sufficient revenue or investments lined up.</li>
<li>If their claim is credible (i.e., they truly have financial backing), then they should be able to <strong>pay the security</strong> without difficulty.</li>
<li>If they <strong>cannot pay</strong>, it questions the <strong>credibility of their case</strong> itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>s.56(4) of AO</strong><br>(4) An arbitral tribunal may make an award dismissing a claim or stay a claim if it has made an order under subsection (1)(a) but the order has not been complied with within the period specified under subsection (3)(a) or extended under subsection (3)(b).</p>

<p>In some cases, even where parties reach an <strong>agreement</strong> on security for costs, <strong>courts may modify</strong> the agreed terms when approving the order.</p>
<p>Practical difficulty:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the proceedings are merely <strong>stayed</strong>, there is the problem of <strong>how long the stay should last</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonged stays</strong> could leave matters <strong>in limbo</strong>, complicating case management.</li>
<li>Determining at what point a matter should be <strong>dismissed after an extended stay</strong> can also be challenging.</li>

<li>It is <strong>not necessary</strong> to take the opponent by surprise.</li>
<li>It can be made <strong>on an inter partes basis</strong> (i.e., with notice to the other side).</li>
</ul>
<p>When seeking security for costs in arbitration, timing is crucial. The earlier you make the application, the better:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Application</strong>: It’s advisable to apply for security for costs <strong>at the very start of the arbitration</strong>. This is because costs are incurred from the outset, and early application minimizes exposure to those costs. <strong>Late applications</strong> could be perceived as <strong>tactical</strong> (e.g., to disrupt or delay the proceedings).</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Advantage</strong>: Making an application early can also put pressure on the claimant. If successful, the claimant may be required to provide security before proceeding with the case. This can disrupt their strategy, as they might be forced to pause their preparations while dealing with the security request.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="2-strategic-considerations">2. Strategic Considerations</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Deterrent to Claimants</strong>: A well-timed application for security can act as a deterrent, particularly if the defendant’s arguments are persuasive. The tribunal may rule that the claimant must provide security before advancing their claim. This shifts the focus from the merits of the claim to the financial capacity of the claimant, which can be an effective strategy to challenge the claim’s viability.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving Financial Integrity</strong>: Security for costs ensures that the defendant does not bear the financial burden of defending against a claim if there’s a high risk that the claimant cannot pay any costs awarded to the defendant after a successful defense.</li>

</ul>
<h5><span id="2-evidence-gathering-during-correspondence">(2) Evidence Gathering During Correspondence</span></h5><ul>

<h4><span id="2-agreement-between-parties-on-security">2. Agreement Between Parties on Security</span></h4><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">💡 Is it possible for the parties to arbitration to reach an agreement regarding the amount or form of security for costs?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, it is entirely possible for both parties to reach an agreement on the issue of security.</p>
<p>Parties have complete freedom to agree on the amount, form, and terms of security.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, if the parties wish for their agreement to have binding force within the arbitration proceedings, it is generally advisable to place the agreement before the tribunal.</p>
<p>If an agreement is presented, the tribunal would normally review it to ensure it is operable — meaning it is sensible, sound, and capable of being implemented.</p>
<p>Provided the agreement is practical and appropriate, the tribunal would typically endorse it without issue.</p>
<p>It should be further noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes a respondent may admit that some security should be provided but may dispute the quantum (amount) of the security required.</li>
<li>In such cases, the parties might negotiate and agree on the appropriate quantum without requiring a contested hearing before the tribunal.</li>
<li>Reaching such an agreement can be efficient and cost-effective.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-considerations-for-the-resisting-party">3. Considerations for the Resisting Party</span></h4><p>Another important question was raised: <strong>From the perspective of the party resisting an application for security, what should be considered?</strong></p>
<p>The key factors for the resisting party include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ability to Pay:</strong> If the resisting party can easily afford the security (e.g., a wealthy individual like Elon Musk with no assets in Hong Kong), it may not be worth the time and expense to resist the application. The focus would then be on progressing the case as efficiently as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Cash Flow:</strong> If paying security would tie up funds needed for other purposes, resisting may be more important.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of Assets:</strong> If the resisting party has tangible, readily enforceable assets in the jurisdiction (e.g., a local bank account, real estate), they could argue that security is unnecessary because enforcement risks are minimal.</li>
<li><strong>Strength of the Claim:</strong> A party may argue that its claim is strong and that the application for security is merely a tactic to stifle a genuine claim.</li>
<li><strong>Status Quo:</strong> If at the time the arbitration was initiated the parties were aware of the resisting party’s financial situation, and the claimant proceeded regardless, this could be a ground to resist a subsequent application for security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, when deciding whether to resist, parties must ask themselves: <strong>Is resisting security truly necessary, or is it merely a tactical move with limited practical benefit?</strong></p>
<h4><span id="4-costs-covered-by-security">4. Costs Covered by Security</span></h4><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">💡 Does security for costs cover only legal costs, or also arbitrators&#x27; fees and other expenses?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>In principle, security can be structured to cover broader costs, including tribunal costs.</p>
<p>In arbitration, the tribunal typically allocates costs between the parties at the end of proceedings.</p>
<p>Thus, any reallocation of costs at the conclusion can factor in what security was provided earlier.</p>
<h4><span id="5-strategic-and-practical-considerations">5. Strategic and Practical Considerations</span></h4><p>When advising clients about security for costs applications, lawyers must carefully weigh strategic considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Materiality:</strong> Will the security truly protect the client’s interests in a meaningful way?</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> If an application for security is delayed too long, the tribunal may be less inclined to grant it.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement Planning:</strong> The logic underlying an application for security is closely tied to concerns about ultimate enforcement of the award. Clients must be advised early about the risk of proceeding through arbitration only to find the other side has no assets at the end.</li>
<li><strong>Client Communication:</strong> It is essential to keep security for costs on the radar throughout the arbitration. Failing to raise the issue early could lead to uncomfortable discussions with clients later, especially if costs cannot be recovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall message is: <strong>Always think carefully and early about security for costs, but apply judgment as to whether an application is necessary and advantageous in each particular case.</strong></p>
<p>In practice, even after a hard-fought application for security for costs, the actual outcome may not always be materially significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a recent case, although the opposing party was ultimately ordered to pay security into court, the amount secured was relatively small.</li>
<li>Some funds were obtained, providing a degree of protection for the client, but it was not a substantial sum.</li>
<li>The case is continuing despite the security, and pursuing security required additional time and cost investment from the client’s legal team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Seeking security for costs is something that should <strong>always be considered</strong>, but it is <strong>not necessarily appropriate or advantageous in every case</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="6-evaluating-whether-to-seek-security">6. Evaluating Whether to Seek Security</span></h4><p>The decision to seek security should be framed by asking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does this action move the client closer to the best possible outcome?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is this something necessary, or is it merely a tactical move?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If tactical, does it provide a meaningful, material advantage?</strong> There are many possible applications and strategies available in arbitration, but <strong>being strategic</strong> — not just tactical — is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes particularly important when dealing with companies that raise arguments (e.g., through judicial reviews or other delaying tactics) but may not ultimately have the financial strength to meet an adverse award. Lawyers must critically assess <strong>whether the effort spent seeking security is justified in view of the broader strategic objectives</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="7-importance-of-keeping-security-for-costs-on-the-radar">7. Importance of Keeping Security for Costs on the Radar</span></h4><p>From a professional perspective, particularly as a practicing lawyer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is critical to keep security for costs in mind throughout the lifespan of a dispute.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Failure to consider it early on</strong> can lead to serious professional and client management issues.<ul>
<li>If, at the conclusion of the arbitration or litigation, a client is unable to recover costs because the opposing party is insolvent, and if security was never considered or pursued, the client may justifiably ask why no action was taken.</li>
<li>This can result in difficult conversations and potentially even financial exposure for the lawyer or law firm if the client refuses to pay legal fees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though there may be situations where:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was not reasonably foreseeable that the opposing party would be unable to pay, or</li>
<li>It would not have been appropriate or strategic to pursue security,<br> it is still <strong>essential to demonstrate that security for costs was at least considered</strong> as part of sound case management.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="8-timing-and-ongoing-assessment">8. Timing and Ongoing Assessment</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Early assessment is key:</strong> Consider applications for security at the earliest appropriate opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Delay can be detrimental:</strong> If too much time passes, there may be no good basis left to justify a security application.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic reassessment:</strong> Even if security was obtained earlier in the proceedings, it may later become inadequate or inappropriate. Security for costs is <strong>not an automatic or static process</strong> — it must be reassessed as the case evolves.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="9-parallel-with-enforcement-planning">9. Parallel with Enforcement Planning</span></h4><p>Security for costs parallels broader concerns about <strong>enforcement</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as enforcement strategies must be considered from the outset (to avoid winning an award that cannot be enforced), <strong>security for costs is about ensuring the arbitration’s success is not hollow</strong>.</li>
<li>Protection measures (whether through interim relief, security for costs, or enforcement planning) must be an integral part of the case strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This perspective ties back to earlier discussions regarding <strong>relief measures available in the PRC</strong>, where interim orders (such as asset preservation orders) are more accessible than in many other jurisdictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>These remedies provide valuable certainty that <strong>assets will be available for enforcement</strong> at the end of the arbitration process if successful.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vi-hkx2fprc-arrangement-for-interim-relief-in-support-of-arbitration">VI. HK&#x2F;PRC Arrangement for Interim Relief in Support of Arbitration</span></h2><h3><span id="a-overview-of-the-arrangement">A. Overview of the Arrangement</span></h3><p>On <strong>October 1, 2019</strong>, the <strong>Arrangement Concerning Mutual Assistance in Court-ordered Interim Measures in Aid of Arbitral Proceedings</strong> between the courts of <strong>Mainland China</strong> and <strong>Hong Kong</strong> came into effect. This arrangement allows the courts of each jurisdiction to award interim measures in support of arbitrations seated in the other territory.</p>
<p>This was a groundbreaking development, as no other jurisdiction had a similar framework until <strong>March 2022</strong>, when <strong>Macau</strong> implemented its own version of the arrangement. The unique mutual assistance between Mainland China and Hong Kong grants <strong>Hong Kong</strong> a distinct advantage as a seat for arbitration, providing protections not available in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The arrangement is applicable only to <strong>Hong Kong-seated arbitrations</strong> administered by certain recognized institutions, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC)</li>
<li>China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) Hong Kong Arbitration Center (HKAC)</li>
<li>International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce – Asia Office</li>
<li>The Hong Kong Maritime Arbitration Group</li>
<li>South China International Arbitration Center (Hong Kong)</li>
<li>eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre</li>
</ul>
<p>Parties wishing to benefit from this arrangement must clearly identify Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration and specify that the proceedings are administered by one of the recognized institutions. It is important to note that <strong>PRC courts</strong> are generally cautious about granting relief beyond preservation measures related to assets or property.</p>
<p>The first application under this arrangement was granted on <strong>October 8, 2019</strong>, by the <strong>Shanghai Maritime Court</strong>, marking the successful implementation of these interim measures.</p>
<h3><span id="b-practical-operation-of-the-arrangement">B. Practical Operation of the Arrangement</span></h3><p>Under this Arrangement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties can <strong>apply directly</strong> to the courts of either Mainland China or Hong Kong for relief to support arbitration proceedings seated in the other jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Mainland China</strong>, applications are limited to three types of preservation measures:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence Preservation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conduct Preservation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Property Preservation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These measures are grounded in <strong>Article 100</strong> of the <strong>PRC Civil Procedure Law</strong>.</p>
<h3><span id="c-understanding-the-types-of-preservation">C. Understanding the Types of Preservation</span></h3><h4><span id="1-property-preservation">1. Property Preservation</span></h4><p>This is very similar to a <strong>proprietary injunction</strong>. It involves <strong>freezing assets</strong> that are either the subject matter of the dispute or are at risk of dissipation before the arbitration is concluded.</p>
<h4><span id="2-conduct-preservation">2. Conduct Preservation</span></h4><p>Conduct preservation orders are comparable to <strong>mandatory injunctions</strong>. They can compel a party to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do something (positive obligation), or</li>
<li>Refrain from doing something (negative obligation).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-evidence-preservation">3. Evidence Preservation</span></h4><p>These orders aim to <strong>secure evidence</strong> for use in proceedings, especially when there is a risk that the evidence might otherwise be destroyed or lost.</p>
<h3><span id="d-preservation-measures-in-hong-kong">D. Preservation Measures in Hong Kong</span></h3><p>In Hong Kong, interim measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injunctions</li>
<li>Other orders aimed at <strong>preserving the status quo</strong> pending the resolution of arbitration proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is either to <strong>prevent imminent harm</strong> or <strong>avoid prejudice</strong> to the arbitration process.</p>
<p>As discussed, these concepts — injunctions, preservation of assets, maintaining the status quo — all fit within the broader scope of interim measures available in arbitration.</p>
<h3><span id="e-requirements-under-the-arrangement">E. Requirements Under the Arrangement</span></h3><h4><span id="1-application-timing">1. Application Timing</span></h4><p>Applications for interim measures can be made <strong>before</strong> the commencement of arbitration or <strong>during</strong> arbitration proceedings.</p>
<h4><span id="2-institutional-requirement">2. Institutional Requirement</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Important</strong>:<br> For an arbitration to qualify under the Arrangement, it <strong>must</strong> be administered by a <strong>recognized Hong Kong institution</strong>.<br> This requirement is found in <strong>Article 2</strong> of the Arrangement.</li>
<li>As of <strong>last week</strong>, the list of qualifying institutions was expanded:<ul>
<li>Originally, a few institutions were recognized.</li>
<li>Now, there are <strong>nine</strong> institutions included, with <strong>three new additions</strong> recently announced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>South China International Arbitration Center (Hong Kong)</strong> — a branch of the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration.</li>
<li>The <strong>Shanghai Arbitration Commission Hong Kong Center</strong>, which opened just last year.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="f-practical-insights-usage-and-impact">F. Practical Insights: Usage and Impact</span></h3><p>Since the Arrangement’s implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around <strong>150 applications</strong> for interim measures have been made.</li>
<li>The majority have involved <strong>asset preservation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over <strong>US$3.5 billion</strong> worth of assets have been frozen through applications under this Arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p>This underscores the <strong>significant practical impact</strong> of the Arrangement in real-world disputes.</p>
<h3><span id="g-practicalities-for-applicants">G. Practicalities for Applicants</span></h3><p>When applying for interim measures in <strong>Mainland China</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must <strong>specify clearly</strong> the proceedings and the relief sought.</li>
<li>Applications must be made to:<ul>
<li>The <strong>intermediate court</strong> at the location of the party against whom the measure is sought, or</li>
<li>The court where the <strong>property</strong> to be preserved is located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The necessary documentation includes (according to <strong>Articles 4 and 5</strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>application</strong> for the interim measure,</li>
<li>The <strong>arbitration agreement</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Identity documents</strong>,</li>
<li>Proof of acceptance of the arbitration case by a <strong>recognized arbitral institution</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it is worth noting that <strong>PRC courts</strong> are generally <strong>cautious</strong> about granting preservation measures and require detailed supporting evidence.</p>
<h3><span id="h-interim-measures-in-hong-kong-arbitration-a-case-study">H. Interim Measures in Hong Kong Arbitration: A Case Study</span></h3><h4><span id="1-introduction-to-the-interim-measure">1. Introduction to the Interim Measure</span></h4><p>In October, the Shanghai Maritime Court granted the first interim measure in the context of Hong Kong proceedings under a specific arrangement. This is a significant milestone in the region’s legal framework, marking the beginning of a practical application of this legal tool.</p>
<h4><span id="2-the-application-process-initial-challenges">2. The Application Process: Initial Challenges</span></h4><p>During the early stages of applying for this measure, there was some confusion within the courts regarding the exact procedures. In fact, when I was personally involved in one of these applications, we encountered a lack of familiarity with how the arrangement should function. At the outset, the courts were unsure of the process, as this was a new regime for them.</p>
<h4><span id="3-strategic-planning-in-arbitration">3. Strategic Planning in Arbitration</span></h4><p>In our case, timing was crucial. We had already prepared our arbitration notes and were ready to proceed, but we needed to ensure that the counterparty was unaware of our intentions. Prematurely filing for arbitration could lead the other party to move assets or anticipate our legal actions, complicating the case.</p>
<p>We had already identified the assets and planned to file our application in the PRC. Before proceeding, we had several discussions with the local court. This is a common practice in the PRC—much different from the procedures here in Hong Kong. We reached out to the judge directly to clarify the arrangement, only to find that the local court was unfamiliar with the process. They had to consult provincial authorities for guidance.</p>
<h4><span id="4-clear-requirements-from-the-court">4. Clear Requirements from the Court</span></h4><p>Once the court had a better understanding of the arrangements, they were more confident in proceeding. They provided us with very specific requirements, which was immensely helpful. For example, the court insisted that we submit all documents in a sealed envelope from the HBIC (Hong Kong Business and Investment Center). This was an additional step we hadn’t anticipated, but it was crucial for ensuring the application proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the HBIC was incredibly cooperative. They helped us compile the necessary documents and ensure everything was in order. As a result, we were able to secure an order from the court relatively quickly, though not immediately. Still, the process was much faster than expected, which allowed us to bring the case back to the negotiation table.</p>
<h4><span id="5-avoiding-arbitration-a-strategic-outcome">5. Avoiding Arbitration: A Strategic Outcome</span></h4><p>Ultimately, the interim measure meant that we didn’t have to proceed with a full arbitration process. This outcome illustrates the utility of these tools in legal strategy, offering an alternative to lengthy and costly proceedings.</p>
<h5><span id="1-the-definition-of-assets-a-key-difference">(1) The Definition of Assets: A Key Difference</span></h5><p>One interesting point to note is the definition of “assets” under the PRC’s regulations. In contrast to Hong Kong’s strict requirements—where you must be specific and provide detailed information about the location of assets (such as account numbers)—the PRC’s approach is slightly more flexible. In the PRC, you can make a more general claim that assets may exist in a particular location or with a specific financial institution. As long as you provide credible evidence to support this belief, the court is generally willing to entertain the application.</p>
<p>This flexibility makes the PRC’s asset preservation regime a valuable tool in cross-border disputes.</p>
<h5><span id="2-cross-jurisdictional-differences-hong-kong-vs-other-jurisdictions">(2) Cross-Jurisdictional Differences: Hong Kong vs. Other Jurisdictions</span></h5><p>It’s important to keep in mind that different legal systems may have different requirements. While we are accustomed to the common law approach in Hong Kong, the rules in other jurisdictions might be more flexible or different. Understanding these nuances is crucial when dealing with international arbitration.</p>
<h4><span id="6-conclusion-and-next-steps">6. Conclusion and Next Steps</span></h4><p>As we move forward, we will review the key factors to consider when seeking an interim measure in arbitration. We will also look more closely at a specific type of security application that may arise in these contexts.</p>

<h1><span id="class-9-costs">Class 9 - Costs</span></h1><p>Cost is an issue that many people prefer to avoid dealing with, especially when it comes to arbitration or litigation. Typically, it is only at the end of long, protracted proceedings that the true cost concerns arise. However, it is crucial to address cost considerations early on, even when you are just beginning to outline your dispute strategy. At this stage, you should be thinking not only about how to minimize costs but also about how to potentially recover costs.</p>
<p>While it might seem like an afterthought, understanding and managing costs from the outset is essential. We’ll cover a variety of cost-related issues, so let’s dive right in.</p>
<h2><span id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</span></h2><h3><span id="a-overview-of-costs">A. Overview of costs</span></h3><p>Difference to substantial claim in arbitration.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">💡 What falls under the broad term of costs?</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>When we talk about “costs” in the context of arbitration or litigation, we are referring to everything that is incurred during the process, excluding the claims themselves. This includes all expenses related to the legal proceedings, except for the actual judgment amount awarded in terms of the claims or counterclaims.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Legal Costs</strong>:<br> The most straightforward type of cost is legal costs—fees paid to lawyers for their services during the dispute resolution process.</li>
<li><strong>Tribunal or Court Costs</strong>:<br> In arbitration, costs also cover the fees associated with the tribunal or arbitral institution. This is a significant difference between arbitration and litigation. In litigation, court costs are typically managed by the court system. However, in arbitration, parties are usually required to pay for the tribunal’s fees directly and often cover other institutional costs as well.</li>
<li><strong>Other Related Costs</strong>:<br> Costs in arbitration go beyond just legal fees. They also include a range of other expenses:<ul>
<li><strong>Hearing Costs</strong>: Expenses related to organizing the hearing, including logistics, travel, and accommodations for participants.</li>
<li><strong>Expert Witness Fees</strong>: Costs for expert testimony or reports, which can be substantial, especially if experts need to travel for hearings.</li>
<li><strong>Travel Costs</strong>: If the arbitration or litigation involves travel between jurisdictions or to various locations for hearings, these costs are also part of the overall costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The distinction between arbitration and litigation is especially clear when it comes to managing costs. As we discussed earlier in the course, in arbitration, the parties bear more responsibility for organizing and paying for the proceedings. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tribunal and Institutional Costs</strong>: In arbitration, parties typically pay for the fees of the tribunal and the institutional costs of the arbitration process.</li>
<li><strong>Hearing Arrangements</strong>: Parties must also make arrangements for the hearing itself, including venue, accommodation, and related logistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, in litigation, many of these costs are handled by the court system. The court will generally provide a venue, manage the scheduling of hearings, and handle many logistical aspects, which simplifies cost management for the parties involved.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">💡 Timing: As counsel, when would you first consider the issue of costs vs when are costs usually calculated and decided? </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<ul>
<li>“Costs follow the event”</li>
</ul>
<p>While arbitration offers flexibility and autonomy in managing the dispute resolution process, it also places a greater burden on the parties to manage and pay for all associated costs. Understanding what constitutes “costs” in both arbitration and litigation, as well as recognizing the differences in how these costs are handled, is essential for a successful and cost-effective dispute strategy. It is important to plan for these costs from the beginning to avoid surprises later in the process.</p>

<p>The Arbitration Ordinance does not define arbitration costs (although many institutional arbitration rules do – see, for example, Article 34 of the HKIAC Rules)</p>
<p>Generally, costs are broad and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs of the tribunal (including the charges for administration of the arbitration by any arbitral institution)</li>
<li>Costs of the arbitration (including hiring the hearing rooms, interpreters, transcript preparation, among other things) </li>
<li>Costs of the parties (including the costs of legal representation, expert witnesses, witness and other travel-related expenditure, among other things)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="c-common-costs-orders">C. Common Costs Orders</span></h3><ul>
<li>“Costs in the cause” : Usually at interlocutory stage, indicating the party that loses the overall action will have to cover costs of that stage.</li>
<li>“[Party’s] costs in any event” : Usually at interlocutory stage, indicating that party awarded costs will recover such costs even if other party ends up winning the action.</li>
<li>“Costs Reserved” : Usually at interlocutory stage, indicating that no cost order is made yet and costs will be decided together with the costs for the full action.</li>
<li>“No Order As To Costs” : Each party pays their own legal fees.</li>
<li>“Costs be to [Party]” : Final cost order entitling party awarded costs to recover same from other party.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="d-concerns-in-legal-practice-cost-considerations">D. Concerns in Legal Practice: Cost Considerations</span></h3><p>One of the main concerns in legal practice, especially in arbitration, revolves around managing costs. This issue often comes up early in a legal discussion, particularly when a client first approaches a solicitor.</p>
<p>Timing is crucial when dealing with costs in arbitration. You need to address cost concerns as early as possible to avoid complications later in the process.</p>
<h4><span id="1-client-concerns-about-cost">1. Client Concerns About Cost</span></h4><p>When a client walks into a lawyer’s office, the very first question they often ask is: <em>“How much will this cost me?”</em> Even before diving into the specifics of the case, clients are primarily concerned about the financial implications. This concern is particularly evident in Hong Kong, where it remains the norm for clients to pay for legal services upfront, rather than working on a contingency basis or relying on third-party funding to cover the costs initially.</p>
<p>As a legal counsel, this question puts immediate pressure on you. Before fully understanding the details of the case, you’re expected to provide a cost estimate. This is tricky because you might not have a complete grasp of the situation yet, but you still need to offer some guidance.</p>
<p>The legal market is highly competitive, with many firms offering services. If you provide a conservative cost estimate, say $5 million USD, the client might immediately go elsewhere, looking for a lower figure, perhaps $100,000, even though that might not be realistic in the end. This creates a dilemma for lawyers in how they estimate costs and balance client expectations.</p>
<h4><span id="2-estimating-and-minimizing-costs">2. Estimating and Minimizing Costs</span></h4><p>One of the challenges in legal practice is how to accurately estimate and minimize costs, especially in the context of arbitration. It’s important to make cost estimates that are as realistic as possible without underestimating or overestimating the expenses. A major aspect of this is to consider the potential outcome of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitration often leads to an outcome where the awarded amount might not match the client’s expectations. Sometimes, despite the legal effort, the client might walk away with little or no compensation. In such cases, the legal fees that the client has paid out-of-pocket become a significant concern. These costs, the legal expenses incurred during the arbitration process, are often a major point of contention.</p>
<p>Clients are usually very keen on recovering legal costs, especially if the arbitration result does not go in their favor. For instance, even if the case is unsuccessful in terms of the claim, the client will still want to recover the costs of the legal services they’ve paid for. This makes the issue of recovering legal costs a critical part of any arbitration process.</p>
<p>If a lawyer provides incorrect advice regarding how to recover these costs or fails to adequately position the case for a favorable outcome regarding cost recovery, clients may be dissatisfied. They may feel that their legal counsel has not done enough to help them recover the costs or settle outstanding legal bills.</p>
<h4><span id="3-legal-counsels-perspective">3. Legal Counsel’s Perspective</span></h4><p>From a legal counsel’s perspective, it’s essential to ensure that your bills are covered, especially at the outset of arbitration. Ideally, you want to ensure that you’re not relying solely on the arbitration’s outcome to recover your fees. If you’ve agreed to a contingency fee arrangement, that’s a different story, but in most cases, lawyers cannot afford to wait until the arbitration outcome to cover their expenses.</p>
<h3><span id="e-early-strategic-thinking">E. Early Strategic Thinking</span></h3><p>There’s an important strategic consideration mentioned during the session of interlocutory applications:</p>
<p>If you are thinking about applying for an injunction to freeze the other side’s assets, you should simultaneously consider two related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which assets should you freeze?</strong> Ideally, they should be assets you could enforce a judgment against.</li>
<li><strong>Should you apply for security for costs at the same early stage?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the considerations behind freezing injunctions and security for costs applications overlap in some ways, they are not identical.  </p>
<p>For now, it is important to recognize that <strong>as early as possible</strong>, you should think carefully about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What will my costs be over the full course of the arbitration?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is the other side financially able to pay my costs if they lose?</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4><span id="3-clear-articulation-and-documentation-of-legal-costs">3. Clear Articulation and Documentation of Legal Costs</span></h4><p>When an arbitration runs for a significant period — say, over a year — and you are preparing for a multi-week hearing, it becomes crucial to clearly articulate the legal costs incurred. At the end of the arbitration, you do not want to simply present a lump sum, such as 1.5 million USD, without being able to explain the breakdown.</p>
<p>Instead, you must be precise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify who worked on the arbitration.</li>
<li>Specify their hourly rates.</li>
<li>Detail how much time was spent on different aspects of the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, you should be able to convincingly demonstrate to the tribunal why each portion of the amount was necessary for the particular case.</p>

Common Types of Cost Orders in Arbitration</span></h4><h5><span id="1-cost-orders-in-court-and-arbitration">(1) Cost Orders in Court and Arbitration</span></h5><p>In Hong Kong courts, and similarly in arbitration proceedings, you often encounter short, somewhat “encrypted” cost orders at the end of interlocutory or substantive hearings. To an untrained ear, these orders might sound vague or unclear. However, it is important to understand their implications.</p>
<p>Typical phrases you may hear include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Costs in any event”</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Costs reserved”</strong></li>
<li><strong>“No order as to costs”</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Costs to [Party B]”</strong> (ideally, your client)</li>

</tbody></table>
<h5><span id="3-practical-implications">(3) Practical Implications</span></h5><p>If no immediate cost order is made at the interlocutory stage, it is essential for you (on behalf of your client) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep detailed records of what occurred during that stage.</li>
<li>Track any cost implications related to court or tribunal orders.</li>
<li>Include these costs later in your final cost submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> assume that judges or arbitrators will remember everything — <strong>it is your responsibility</strong> to document and clearly present the relevant costs when the time comes.</p>
<p>In some instances, a tribunal or court might order a party to pay costs immediately, for example, within 14 days. If that happens, prompt compliance is required.</p>
<h4><span id="5-controlling-costs-at-different-stages">5. Controlling Costs at Different Stages</span></h4><h5><span id="1-choices-made-at-the-contract-stage">(1) Choices Made at the Contract Stage</span></h5><p>Some cost-control decisions are made <strong>before</strong> the dispute even arises — at the <strong>drafting stage</strong> of the arbitration clause.</p>
<p>However, if you are hired after the dispute starts, you may be <strong>“stuck”</strong> with whatever clause the corporate team drafted years ago.</p>
<p>Still, here are some considerations that can affect costs when drafting an arbitration clause:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Number of Arbitrators</strong>:</p>
<p>Do you really need a <strong>three-member panel</strong>, or would a <strong>sole arbitrator</strong> suffice?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Language of Arbitration</strong>:</p>
<p>Do you want a <strong>bilingual arbitration</strong>?</p>
<p>Translation costs can be significant, so sticking to <strong>one language</strong> could save money.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Governing Law and Seat</strong>:</p>
<p>Choosing a <strong>simple and familiar legal system</strong> may avoid complexity and reduce legal expenses.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Venue of Arbitration</strong>:</p>
<p>Specifying a <strong>convenient and cost-effective venue</strong> can also help manage costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="2-choices-made-during-the-arbitration">(2) Choices Made During the Arbitration</span></h5><p>Beyond the contract, <strong>how you manage the arbitration</strong> has a <strong>much greater impact</strong> on the overall cost:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Aggressiveness of Strategy</strong>:</p>
<p>If you take every possible opportunity to file <strong>interlocutory applications</strong> (i.e., procedural fights), your costs will skyrocket and the arbitration will drag on.</p>
<p>Conversely, a <strong>more focused and less aggressive approach</strong> — concentrating only on <strong>major issues</strong> — can significantly reduce time and expenses.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>However</strong>, sometimes being aggressive is necessary.<br> For example, you might need to take early actions like applying to <strong>freeze the opponent’s assets</strong>, which could end the dispute quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="3-role-of-arbitrators-in-managing-costs">(3) Role of Arbitrators in Managing Costs</span></h5><p>Finally, <strong>case management by arbitrators</strong> is crucial:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experienced arbitrators</strong> tend to have established, practical procedures to <strong>control the timetable and costs</strong>.</li>
<li>They can <strong>identify and resist delaying tactics</strong> by one party, preventing unnecessary escalation of expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="6-powers-of-the-arbitrator-and-cost-considerations-in-arbitration">6. Powers of the Arbitrator and Cost Considerations in Arbitration</span></h4><h5><span id="1-balancing-the-interests-of-both-parties">(1) Balancing the Interests of Both Parties</span></h5><p>A fundamental responsibility of the arbitrator is to <strong>balance the interests of both parties</strong> carefully. While the arbitrator holds certain powers to control the proceedings, they must exercise these powers <strong>prudently and fairly</strong>. In particular, an arbitrator should avoid being excessively strict—for instance, by unduly <strong>rejecting requests for document production, additional submissions, or certifications</strong>. Overzealous restriction could risk compromising the fairness and integrity of the process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>the arbitrator’s powers are not absolute</strong>; they must act within certain limits, ensuring both parties are given a reasonable opportunity to present their case.</p>
<h5><span id="2-costs-related-to-arbitration-proceedings">(2) Costs Related to Arbitration Proceedings</span></h5><p>In institutional arbitration (such as cases administered by the HKIAC), there are <strong>standard costs</strong> that the parties must bear. As shown on the screen during the lecture, these costs typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registration fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Administrative fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arbitrators’ fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Costs related to hearings and travel expenses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When filing a request for arbitration, <strong>the claimant must be prepared to pay</strong> these initial fees, particularly the <strong>registration fee</strong>, to successfully commence proceedings.</p>
<p>This can pose a <strong>significant challenge for claimants with limited assets</strong>, an issue we will discuss further under the topic of <strong>security for costs</strong>. Nevertheless, it is crucial that any claimant seeking to initiate arbitration ensures they have <strong>sufficient financial resources at least to cover the basic initial costs</strong>.</p>
<h5><span id="3-responsibility-for-advance-payments">(3) Responsibility for Advance Payments</span></h5><p>The <strong>advance on costs</strong> is typically shared between both parties. However, if one party refuses or fails to pay their share, the other party must be prepared to <strong>cover the defaulting party’s portion</strong> temporarily. While this amount can usually be <strong>recovered later</strong> through a cost award at the end of the proceedings, clients may find it <strong>unexpected and burdensome</strong> to have to pay not only their own costs but also <strong>the other side’s share</strong> upfront.</p>
<p>Thus, it is important to <strong>advise clients in advance</strong> of this possibility, so they are not caught off guard during the arbitration.</p>
<h2><span id="iii-costs-in-arbitration">III. Costs in Arbitration</span></h2><p>How are parties made to pay costs?</p>
<p>Why does the issue of costs need to be covered in an award?</p>
<h3><span id="intro-understanding-and-managing-arbitration-costs">Intro: Understanding and Managing Arbitration Costs</span></h3><h4><span id="1-basic-principle-who-pays-the-costs">1. Basic Principle: Who Pays the Costs?</span></h4><p>Generally speaking, in arbitration, <strong>the losing party pays the costs of the winning party</strong>. However, this is not automatic. Tribunals have <strong>wide discretion</strong> when deciding on costs, and several factors can influence the outcome.<br> It is possible, for instance, that a losing party:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovers some of its own costs</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>Avoids paying the full amount</strong> of the winning party’s costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will examine these factors in more detail later.</p>
<h4><span id="2-what-costs-are-included">2. What Costs Are Included?</span></h4><p>When we talk about “costs” in arbitration, it is a <strong>very broad term</strong> that covers multiple categories:</p>
<h5><span id="1-costs-of-the-tribunal">(1) Costs of the Tribunal</span></h5><p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees and expenses of the arbitrators</li>
<li>Administrative fees charged by the arbitral institution</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="2-costs-of-the-arbitration-proceedings">(2) Costs of the Arbitration Proceedings</span></h5><p>This is often an extensive list, particularly in complex or large hearings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venue costs</strong>: Hotel bookings for participants</li>
<li><strong>Logistical costs</strong>: Catering, interpreters, transcription services</li>
<li><strong>Transportation of materials</strong>: Shipping boxes of documents or printing bundles locally</li>
<li><strong>Other services</strong>: Technical support, document management, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizing an arbitration hearing can be a significant logistical operation. Throughout this process, it is critical to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document all incurred costs carefully</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assess whether each cost is reasonable</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider early agreements with the other party on shared costs where possible</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="3-costs-incurred-by-the-parties">(3) Costs Incurred by the Parties</span></h5><p>This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal representation fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Expert witness fees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Travel-related expenses</strong> (e.g., airfare, accommodation for counsel, witnesses, and experts)</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="3-the-importance-of-cost-management">3. The Importance of Cost Management</span></h4><p>At the end of the arbitration, you will need to present a <strong>comprehensive list of all your costs</strong>.</p>
<p>While there is <strong>no guarantee</strong> that the tribunal will award you full recovery, <strong>proper documentation and reasonable justification</strong> for each cost will significantly strengthen your position. You must be able to clearly explain <strong>why</strong> each cost was necessary.</p>
<h3><span id="a-institutional-arbitration">A. Institutional arbitration</span></h3><p>In arbitration, the issue of costs is an important consideration, particularly after an application has been made and the tribunal decides on its jurisdiction. This process can already involve substantial submissions and hearings, resulting in costs up to that point. These costs may be incurred before any further proceedings, such as enforcement, occur, particularly when there is an amendment to the tribunal or a ruling regarding jurisdiction.</p>
<h4><span id="1-tribunal-and-administrative-costs-overview">1. Tribunal and Administrative Costs Overview</span></h4><p>Note that this discussion only covers the <strong>legal costs</strong> associated with the proceedings. It does <strong>not</strong> include institutional fees or tribunal fees.</p>
<p>A quick reference point: The average costs published by HKIAC (Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre) from <strong>2013 and 2023</strong> have <strong>not yet been updated</strong> to reflect the most recent changes over the past year.</p>
<p>If you visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.hkiac.org/">HKIAC</a> website, you can get a clear impression of how much you typically pay for the tribunal and administrative services in an arbitration.</p>
<p>On average, the cost is around <strong>USD 161,000 to 162,000</strong>.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to understand that as the <strong>amount in dispute increases</strong>, these costs <strong>add up</strong> significantly. The higher the value of the dispute, the more expensive it becomes to pay for the services of the HKIAC and the tribunal.</p>
<p>At first glance, USD 160,000 may sound like a relatively high amount.</p>
<p>But in reality, this figure usually represents <strong>only a small fraction</strong> of the <strong>overall costs</strong> involved in running a large, complex arbitration.</p>
<p>To illustrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>partner at an international law firm</strong> often charges around <strong>USD 500 per hour</strong>.</li>
<li>A complex arbitration typically requires a <strong>team</strong>, not just one senior lawyer.<br> You might need:<ul>
<li>Two or three partners</li>
<li>Two counsel</li>
<li>Five associates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition to lawyer fees, there are <strong>expert fees</strong> and <strong>travel costs</strong> to consider.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add all these elements together, it becomes clear that the <strong>costs for the tribunal and the HKIAC are relatively minor</strong> compared to the <strong>total expenses</strong> of the arbitration.</p>

<h4><span id="2-high-value-disputes-costs-scale-up-but-proportion-remains-small">2. High-Value Disputes: Costs Scale Up but Proportion Remains Small</span></h4><p>For <strong>very complex cases</strong>, such as those involving <strong>hundreds of millions of US dollars</strong>, the tribunal and administrative costs will, of course, <strong>be higher than USD 160,000</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Even then</strong>, their share remains <strong>small</strong> compared to the overall cost of conducting the arbitration.</p>
<p>➡️ <strong>Key point:</strong></p>

<h3><span id="b-europe">B. Europe</span></h3><ul>
<li>Losing party can be compelled to pay the legal costs of the winning party. </li>
<li>E.g., English Arbitration Act, 1996 §61(2) Act provides that, absent contrary agreement, “the tribunal shall award costs on the general principle that costs should follow the event except where it appears to the tribunal that in the circumstances this is not appropriate in relation to the whole or part of the costs.”</li>
<li>UK Arbitration Act 2025 allows tribunals to make a cost order even if they or a court have decided the tribunal has no jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="c-united-states">C. United States</span></h3><ul>
<li>Principally in the context of domestic arbitrations, a number of U.S. courts have held that arbitrators lack the power in an US-seated arbitration under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act to award legal fees unless the parties have expressly conferred this authority on the tribunal – the so-called “American Rule” against fee-shifting.</li>
<li>Recently however, a number of U.S. courts have concluded that arbitrators have implied authority to award attorneys’ fees.</li>
<li>Moreover, as a practical matter, the “American Rule” should generally have little influence on the standards adopted by international arbitral tribunals seated in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="d-international-commercial-arbitration">D. International commercial arbitration</span></h3><ul>
<li>Tribunal can assess the legal costs between the two parties as it finds appropriate. </li>
<li>Most institutional arbitration rules expressly grant arbitral tribunals the power to award the costs of the arbitration (including legal costs).</li>
<li>Even where applicable institutional rules are silent on costs, the parties’ arbitration agreement should be interpreted to impliedly grant such authority to the tribunal.</li>
<li>2021 ICC Rules Article 38(4) “The final award shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear them or in what proportion they shall be borne by the parties.” The “costs of the arbitration” are defined to include “reasonable legal and other costs” (Article 38(1))</li>
<li>2020 LCIA Rules provide for the arbitral tribunal to “decide the proportions in which the parties shall bear” the costs of the arbitration (as fixed by the LCIA Court) (Article 28.2), as well as to “have the power to decide by an order or award that all or part of the legal or other expenses incurred by a party (the “Legal Costs”) be paid by another party.” (Article 28.3) Absent contrary agreement, “costs should reflect the parties’ relative success and failure in the award or arbitration or under different issues, except where it appears to the Arbitral Tribunal that in the circumstances the application of such a general principle would be inappropriate under the Arbitration Agreement or otherwise.” (Article 28.4)</li>
<li>2018 HKIAC Rules provide that the arbitral tribunal may apportion all or part of the costs of the arbitration (Article 34.3). The arbitral tribunal shall determine the costs of the arbitration in one or more orders or awards (Article 34.1). “Costs of the arbitration” include legal costs (Article 34.1).</li>
<li>2025 SIAC Rules Tribunal has the power to order in the award that all or a part of a party’s legal or other costs shall be paid by another party.

<h2><span id="iv-costs-estimation-and-allocation">IV. Costs estimation and allocation</span></h2><h3><span id="a-costs-allocation">A. Costs Allocation</span></h3><h4><span id="1-principles-governing-the-allocation-of-costs">1. Principles Governing the Allocation of Costs</span></h4><h5><span id="1-the-general-rule-costs-follow-the-event">(1) The General Rule: Costs Follow the Event</span></h5><p>In most jurisdictions, the <strong>general principle</strong> is that <strong>the losing party bears the costs</strong> of the winning party. This principle aims to compensate the successful party for the expenses they incurred in pursuing or defending the arbitration.</p>
<h5><span id="2-fee-shifting-in-arbitration">(2) Fee Shifting in Arbitration</span></h5><p>A notable point is the rule against fee shifting, which is often present in jurisdictions such as the United States. This rule essentially means that each party is responsible for its own legal costs, even if they lose the arbitration. In international arbitration, this concept is not widely accepted. In many international commercial arbitrations, the tribunal typically has the power to assess legal costs between the parties and make an appropriate order regarding who bears those costs.</p>
<p>Generally, the prevailing party is entitled to recover its costs from the losing party, but this is not a hard and fast rule. There are exceptions where the tribunal may determine a different cost allocation based on the circumstances of the case.</p>
<h4><span id="2-overall-considerations-for-cost-allocation">2. Overall Considerations for Cost Allocation</span></h4><p>When allocating costs, the tribunal considers the overall fairness of the proceedings. If one party has access to significant resources, such as a large international law firm, while the opposing party may be represented by a local solicitor, the tribunal must ensure that the less-resourced party is not unfairly penalized for taking a more economical approach. Additionally, the complexity and necessity of expert involvement will also influence the tribunal’s decision.</p>
<p><strong>Considerations for Fair Cost Allocation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The relative financial resources of the parties</li>
<li>The necessity of expert involvement and the complexity of the case</li>
<li>Ensuring that the less-resourced party is not unfairly penalized</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-judicial-discretion-to-depart-from-the-general-rule">B. Judicial Discretion to Depart from the General Rule</span></h3><p>Arbitration statutes generally do not provide specific guidance on the method of cost allocation, leaving the decision primarily to the tribunal, though they emphasize the importance of the parties’ agreement. Section 74 of the Arbitration Ordinance grants tribunals significant discretion in awarding and allocating costs.</p>
<p>International arbitration rules typically grant tribunals broad discretion regarding the award of costs, including who should bear them and in what amount. For example, the ICC Rules (37.4 &amp; 37.5), the HKIAC Rules (34.2 &amp; 34.3), and the ICSID Convention (Article 61(2)) all provide tribunals with the authority to decide cost allocation based on the case’s specific circumstances.</p>
<p>The allocation of costs is ultimately a matter of discretion, with tribunals having flexibility to depart from default rules when necessary. Several factors can influence the tribunal’s decision, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conduct of the parties during the proceedings</li>
<li>The complexity of the case</li>
<li>Whether either party acted unreasonably or unnecessarily increased the costs</li>
</ul>
<p>While the “costs follow the event” principle is commonly applied, it is not absolute, and each case must be evaluated individually.</p>
<p>Some arbitration rules, however, such as those of UNCITRAL, CIETAC, LCIA, and the PCA, include a rebuttable presumption that the successful party may recover costs from the unsuccessful party. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Article 42 of the 2013 UNCITRAL Rules</strong>: The unsuccessful party generally bears the costs of the arbitration, but the arbitral tribunal has the discretion to apportion costs based on the circumstances of the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Article 42 of 2013 UNCITRAL Rules</strong><br>The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 74 of the Arbitration Ordinance also provides tribunals with similar powers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Awarding costs</strong>: The tribunal may include provisions regarding the costs of the proceedings in its award, including the fees and expenses of the tribunal itself.</li>
<li><strong>Discretion</strong>: The tribunal can allocate costs in a manner it deems appropriate, considering all relevant circumstances, including whether a party made a settlement offer.</li>
<li><strong>Additional costs</strong>: The tribunal may also order one party to bear additional costs incurred from requests for interim measures or other directions.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment of costs</strong>: Tribunals are required to assess the costs to be awarded, except for the tribunal’s own fees, and ensure that they are reasonable, considering the circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Limits on cost recovery</strong>: Provisions requiring parties to bear their own costs are generally void, unless the arbitration agreement pertains to disputes arising before the agreement.</li>

<li><strong>Arbitral tribunal may award costs of arbitral proceedings</strong><br>(1) An arbitral tribunal may include in an award directions with respect to the costs of arbitral proceedings (including the fees and expenses of the tribunal).<br>(2) The arbitral tribunal may, having regard to all relevant circumstances (including the fact, if appropriate, that a written offer of settlement of the dispute concerned has been made), direct in the award under subsection (1) to whom and by whom and in what manner the costs are to be paid.<br>(3) The arbitral tribunal may also, in its discretion, order costs (including the fees and expenses of the tribunal) to be paid by a party in respect of a request made by any of the parties for an order or direction (including an interim measure).<br>(4) The arbitral tribunal may direct that the costs ordered under subsection (3) are to be paid forthwith or at the time that the tribunal may otherwise specify.<br>(5) Subject to section 75, the arbitral tribunal must—<br>(a) assess the amount of costs to be awarded or ordered to be paid under this section (other than the fees and expenses of the tribunal); and<br>(b) award or order those costs (including the fees and expenses of the tribunal).<br>(6) Subject to subsection (7), the arbitral tribunal is not obliged to follow the scales and practices adopted by the court on taxation when assessing the amount of costs (other than the fees and expenses of the tribunal) under subsection (5).<br>(7) The arbitral tribunal—<br>(a) must only allow costs that are reasonable having regard to all the circumstances; and<br>(b) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, may allow costs incurred in the preparation of the arbitral proceedings prior to the commencement of the arbitration.<br>(8) A provision of an arbitration agreement to the effect that the parties, or any of the parties, must pay their own costs in respect of arbitral proceedings arising under the agreement is void.<br>(9) A provision referred to in subsection (8) is not void if it is part of an agreement to submit to arbitration a dispute that had arisen before the agreement was made.</li>

<p>The <strong>HKIAC 2024 Administered Arbitration Rules</strong> (Article 34.4) similarly grants tribunals discretion in determining the reasonableness of costs and the manner in which costs are apportioned. Factors such as the relative success of the parties, the complexity of the dispute, the conduct of the parties, third-party funding arrangements, and environmental impacts may be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>34.4 In determining (i) whether the costs of the arbitration referred to in Article 34.1 are reasonable and (ii) whether and how to apportion the costs of the arbitration in accordance with Article 34.3, the arbitral tribunal shall take into account the circumstances of the case. The arbitral tribunal may take into account any factors it considers relevant, including but not limited to:<br>(a) the relative success of the parties;<br>(b) the scale and complexity of the dispute;<br>(c) the conduct of the parties in relation to the proceedings;<br>(d) any third party funding arrangement;<br>(e) any outcome related fee structure agreement; and&#x2F;or<br>(f) any adverse environmental impact arising out of the parties’ conduct in the arbitration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tribunal’s discretion extends not only to the allocation of costs but also to determining the reasonableness of the costs incurred. Considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of issues determined in favor of each party</li>
<li>The amount claimed versus the amount awarded</li>
<li>The resources allocated to specific issues in pleadings and evidence</li>
<li>Any interlocutory applications made</li>
<li>The parties’ behavior during the proceedings</li>
<li>A comparison of the parties’ respective costs</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is essentially a balancing exercise aimed at achieving a fair allocation of costs based on the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p>A recent development in the <strong>Arbitration Act 2025</strong> has introduced an amendment that allows tribunals to make a costs order even if they lack jurisdiction over the dispute. This means that even if the tribunal finds it does not have the power to hear the case, it retains the authority to determine and allocate costs. This amendment ensures procedural fairness, allowing a party that has been involved in defending against an improper or improperly initiated arbitration to recover its legal expenses.</p>
<h3><span id="c-factors-affecting-the-award-of-costs">C. Factors Affecting the Award of Costs</span></h3><p>The allocation of costs in international arbitration is ultimately guided by the principles of fairness and reasonableness. While the general rule favors the prevailing party recovering its costs, various factors, including the complexity of the case, the conduct of the parties, and the relative success of the parties on the claims, can influence the final decision. Tribunals are granted significant discretion in this area, ensuring that each case is assessed on its individual merits.</p>
<h4><span id="1-relative-success-of-the-parties">1. Relative Success of the Parties</span></h4><p>Determining the “winner” or “loser” in an arbitration case is not always straightforward. Unlike a clear-cut win in a sports game, one party may succeed on several points but fail on a key issue that impacts the overall outcome. For instance, a party might win on minor claims but lose on a major issue, significantly affecting the party’s ability to recover funds. In such cases, the tribunal must carefully assess whether the successful party should be entitled to recover all legal costs or if a more equitable distribution is appropriate. In some instances, the tribunal may decide that both parties should bear their own costs or that the losing party only covers part of the costs.</p>
<h4><span id="2-complexity-of-the-dispute">2. Complexity of the Dispute</span></h4><p>The scale and complexity of the dispute play a major role in cost allocation. In some cases, high costs may arise from the use of expert witnesses. A party might argue that the dispute requires expert evidence, while the opposing party may claim that the dispute is relatively straightforward. Ultimately, the tribunal will assess whether expert evidence was genuinely necessary or if it unnecessarily inflated the costs. If the tribunal finds that certain complexities, such as lengthy expert testimony, were not essential, it may adjust the cost allocation accordingly.</p>
<h4><span id="3-conduct-of-the-parties">3. Conduct of the Parties</span></h4><p>The conduct of the parties during the arbitration is a crucial factor in determining cost allocation. If one party is found to have introduced unnecessary complexity or acted in bad faith, the tribunal may be less inclined to award that party full reimbursement for its costs. For instance, engaging in overly technical arguments that complicate the proceedings without significantly advancing the resolution of the dispute may lead the tribunal to view the party unfavorably when allocating costs.</p>
<p>Similarly, a party’s lack of cooperation in disclosing evidence or causing delays in the proceedings can impact the cost allocation. This includes failure to respond to requests, submitting contradictory statements, or introducing expert evidence late in the process, which can lead to additional time and costs. In such cases, the tribunal may decide not to allow the party to recover costs, even if they ultimately prevail in the arbitration, due to their conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Unhelpful Conduct:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to disclose requested evidence or documents</li>
<li>Submitting contradictory statements</li>
<li>Introducing expert testimony at a late stage, requiring further time for the opposing party to respond</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions can be seen as unhelpful or as wasting time, which the tribunal will consider when allocating costs.</p>

The Renco Group Inc v The Republic of Peru (UNCT&#x2F;13&#x2F;1)</span></h4><p>A notable case highlights <strong>how the tribunal handles cost allocation when the unsuccessful party has failed to meet procedural requirements</strong>. In this case, a party that acquired a mine in Peru brought a claim against Peru regarding environmental requirements.

As a result, the claim was dismissed, and the tribunal had to address the issue of cost allocation. </p>

<h5><span id="1-background">(1) Background</span></h5><p>Renco claimed damages from Peru after Peru failed to fulfil its promise to clean up contamination in the soil at a smelting and refining complex, which it had sold to Renco in 1997.</p>
<p>Article 10.18(2) of the US-Trade Promotion Agreement (“TPA”) contained a condition that no claim may be submitted to arbitration unless the relevant Notice of Arbitration is accompanied by a written waiver by the claimant of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 of the TPA.</p>
<h5><span id="2-the-dispute">(2) The Dispute</span></h5><p>Renco filed an amended Notice of Arbitration in August 2011, which was accompanied by a written waiver. The final sentence of the waiver stated: “… the Claimant reserves the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits.”</p>
<p>Peru challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction and argued that Renco’s waiver did not conform to the requirements of Article 10.18(2) as it contained a reservation of rights. However, Peru did not raise this objection until March 2014, after Renco had filed its Memorial on Liability, including witness statements and expert reports.</p>
<p>The tribunal dismissed Renco’s claims, in a partial award on jurisdiction on 15 July 2016, on the basis that its waiver did not comply with the requirements of the TPA. The tribunal said that Article 10.18(2) did not permit any reservation of rights, which was exactly what Renco’s waiver was purporting to do. </p>
<p>The Tribunal reserved its decision on the question of costs</p>
<h5><span id="3-the-parties-positions">(3) The Parties’ Positions</span></h5><p>Peru pointed to Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which establishes a presumption that the costs of an arbitration is to be borne by the unsuccessful party, and argued that Renco should therefore bear its costs. Peru also pointed to the fact that Renco had opposed every attempt Peru made to expeditiously determine the merits of its objection to the waiver.</p>
<p>Renco argued that Peru’s delay in raising its objection to the waiver caused Renco to incur substantial and unnecessary expense of a full merits filing, and that Peru should therefore bear its costs in this regard.</p>
<h5><span id="4-the-award">(4) The Award</span></h5><p>The tribunal noted that Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules did establish a presumption that the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party</p>
<p>Renco is to be regarded as the “unsuccessful party”.</p>
<p>Three circumstances which justified a departure from the presumption that the unsuccessful party must pay the costs</p>
<p>In particular, the tribunal stated that it was </p>
<p>“troubled by the manner in which Peru’s waiver objection had arisen in the context of the arbitration” and that it considered that “the proceedings could have been conducted more efficiently if Peru had raised a clear and specific objection to the reservation of rights in Renco’s written waiver at the very outset of the arbitration”.</p>
<p>However, the Tribunal did note that Peru’s waiver objection had not been “tainted by any ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco’s claims”. Therefore, the tribunal considered that Peru should not be required to pay Renco’s costs, and an order that each party pays its own costs (and half of the arbitration costs) was appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<h5><span id="5-conclusion">(5) Conclusion</span></h5><p>The way in which a party conducts an arbitration can be taken into account by an arbitral tribunal, and have significant consequences.</p>
<p>Parties should ensure that arguments that are potentially determinative of the dispute should be raised at the earliest opportunity. Delay in raising such arguments may result in adverse costs decisions.</p>

<p>Case concerning enforcement of an arbitral award. Applicant failed to inform English court that defendant’s challenge of the award in Greece (the seat of the arbitration) might constitute a defence to enforcement in England. While application to enforce award ultimately successful, court held that this “serious” and “material” omission meant it would be unjust for the defendant to pay the claimant’s costs.</p>
<p>The allocation of costs in arbitration involves a nuanced consideration of various factors, including the conduct of the parties, third-party funding, environmental impact, and the overall fairness of the proceedings. Tribunals must balance these considerations to ensure that costs are allocated in a manner that reflects the actions and resources of the parties involved. The evolving nature of cost-related considerations, such as the growing role of third-party funding and the environmental impact of conduct, further complicates the allocation process, requiring tribunals to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

Seller (Germany) (Final Award), ICCCase No. ICC-FA-2021-068, 2021</span></h4><p>“In general, both Parties proceeded reasonably and in good faith and had conducted the arbitration in a cost-effective manner. Quite a number of legal and factual issues had to be processed and there is no doubt that a substantial amount of time and effort had to be expended in preparation and presentation of the facts and implications. The Sole Arbitrator is of the opinion that also the costs of both Parties incurred in connection with Claimant’s Submission 3, which was granted to Claimant with the explicit consent of Respondent, are recoverable. The Sole Arbitrator does not share the opinion of Claimant that these costs have been incurred by inadmissible ‘new arguments’ and ‘new evidence’ in Respondent’s Submission 2 and should therefore be borne by Respondent.” </p>
<p>“The only costs on Respondent’s side, which seem not to be reasonable to the Sole Arbitrator, are the costs for the attendance of Ms. Greene to the hearing. While it is reasonable for the managing director of Respondent (Mr. Charles Grey) as representative of Respondent to attend the hearing despite the fact that he was not giving any testimony, it seems to be neither necessary nor reasonable for Respondent to have another employee attending the hearing.”</p>
<p>“On the basis of these considerations and regarding that Claimant was successful only with a very small amount of its claims (approximately 0.5 percent of the amount in dispute), the Sole Arbitrator decides that Claimant shall be liable to reimburse Respondent’s total legal and other costs incurred in this arbitration, as well as costs of arbitration […]”</p>

Airway Communications Int’l Holding Co. (Final Award (Corrected)), HKIAC Case No. 13043, 17 November 2014</span></h4><p>S.74(7) of the Ordinance provides that, in the absence of an agreement by the parties to the contrary, the award may include costs incurred in the preparation of the arbitral proceedings prior to commencement of the arbitration. There is no agreement precluding an award of those costs in this case.</p>
<p>In considering what reasonable sum to award for the Claimants costs, the Tribunal has taken account of a number of factors [specialist arbitration solicitors; years of accounting materials in evidence; large witness statements and voluminous documentation; expert evidence]</p>
<p>The Tribunal has carefully considered the material on the issue of costs submitted by the Claimants. It consists, without any statement of explanation, of billed and estimated costs and disbursements. The Tribunal is not in a position to judge to what extent the estimated figures are accurate although it notes that at least what is described as “estimated” Counsel’s fees are the subject of fee invoices from Mr Manzoni [well known barrister in HK] and Mr Lam. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to make a deduction to cater for the margin of error in any estimate, but otherwise see no basis for reducing the claim which appears to me to be reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>
<h3><span id="e-proof-of-costs">E. Proof of Costs</span></h3><p>Generally no rules provide for what what is required to prove costs</p>
<p>Tribunal should be satisfied that such costs were incurred</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether costs are contested by parties</li>
<li>Schedules of costs</li>
<li>Invoices and other supporting documentation</li>
<li>Allocation of costs per stage of arbitration</li>
<li>Narratives &#x2F; detailed statements of work</li>
</ul>
<p>Contingency arrangements &#x2F; unpaid legal fees</p>
<h3><span id="f-environmental-impact-considerations">F. Environmental Impact Considerations</span></h3><p>A relatively new development in the 2024 arbitration rules is the consideration of adverse environmental impacts due to party conduct. The tribunal may now account for factors such as unnecessary travel costs, particularly when virtual attendance (e.g., via Zoom) could have been a viable alternative. If a party insists on in-person attendance, leading to unnecessary environmental costs, such as expensive travel and accommodation, this could influence the cost allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Example of Environmental Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The unnecessary travel of experts, particularly when virtual attendance is possible</li>
<li>Excessive travel-related costs, such as flying experts in and booking five-star hotels, may be considered wasteful and taken into account by the tribunal</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="v-security-for-costs">V. Security for Costs</span></h2><p>Before moving deeper into the topic, it is helpful to quickly revisit what is crucial when considering a security for costs application. </p>
<p>Security for costs serves to protect a party from the risk that the other side might not be able to pay an adverse costs award. Thus, early cost forecasting and risk assessment are vital strategic steps.</p>
<h3><span id="a-section-561a-and-563-of-the-arbitration-ordinance">A. Section 56(1)(a) and 56(3) of the Arbitration Ordinance.</span></h3><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>General powers exercisable by arbitral tribunal<br>(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, when conducting arbitral proceedings, an arbitral tribunal may make an order-<br>(a) requiring a claimant to give security for the costs of the arbitration;<br>(3) An arbitral tribunal-<br>(a) must, when making an order under subsection (1)(a), specify the period within which the order has to be complied with; and<br>(b) may extend that period or an extended period.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Who brings an application for security for costs?</p>
<p>When&#x2F;why&#x2F;what?</p>
<p>Factors: </p>
<p>(1) Prospects of success of the claims, counterclaims and defences; </p>
<p>(2) Party’s ability to comply with an adverse costs award; </p>
<p>(3) Whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to order one party to provide security;</p>
<p>(4) Any other relevant circumstances.</p>
<p>Impecuniosity alone is not a ground; concerns of access to justice</p>
<p>Generally accepted that it is in “exceptional” circumstances</p>
<h3><span id="b-third-party-fundings-implication-on-security-for-costs">B. Third party funding’s implication on security for costs</span></h3><p>Applicants have increasingly tried to rely on the use of third party funding by the opposing party to justify security for costs on the basis that (i) the claimant&#x2F;opposing party is likely to be impecunious, and (ii) the third party funder who is not a party to the arbitration has no obligation to satisfy any costs award and will be able to walk away if unsuccessful. </p>
<p>Third-party funding has become more prevalent in arbitration, with the funder covering the costs of the arbitration. Although the actual party bringing the claim may not directly bear legal costs, as these are paid by the third-party funder, the tribunal may still consider these costs as part of the overall arbitration expenses and may allow them to be recoverable.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Third-Party Funding on Costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The third-party funder incurs their own costs, including strategy development</li>
<li>The party bringing the claim may not directly pay for legal services, but the costs still contribute to the arbitration process</li>
<li>These costs may still be recoverable if deemed necessary for the proceedings</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is currently no consensus on whether the mere involvement of third-party funding is sufficient to justify ordering security for costs.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RSM v Saint Lucia (2014) </p>
<p>  In this case, security for costs was ordered based on “truly exceptional circumstances,” including a claimant with a history of frivolous proceedings and failure to pay resulting costs awards. The tribunal was concerned that, due to third-party funding, the claimant might not comply with a costs award, as the funder would not be obligated to cover it without security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the admitted third party funding further supports the Tribunal’s concern that Claimant will not comply with a costs award rendered against it, since, in the absence of security or guarantees being offered, it is doubtful whether the third party will assume responsibility for honouring such an award.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Hyflux Ltd v Lum Ooi Lin [2023] SGHC 113</p>
<p>  In this case, the plaintiffs, companies in liquidation or receivership, had obtained litigation funding. The court ruled that while the plaintiff was not restricted to any specific form of security, it had the burden to demonstrate that the proposed form of security was “adequate.” The court found that the funder had sufficient assets, and the proposed irrevocable and unconditional undertaking was deemed satisfactory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ps were companies in liquidation or under receivership who had obtained litigation funding.  At issue was the form of the security to be given.</p>
<p>Court held plaintiff (i) is not restricted to any fixed form of security, but (ii) has the burden to demonstrate proposed form of security is “adequate”.</p>
<p>Undertaking was irrevocable and unconditional, and, based on public financial information, court satisfied the funder had sufficient assets.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, third-party funding played a significant role in the tribunal’s or court’s considerations regarding security for costs, although the approach and reasoning varied.</p>
<h2><span id="vi-cost-deduction-and-reduction-in-court-and-arbitration">VI. Cost Deduction and Reduction in Court and Arbitration</span></h2><h3><span id="a-general-approach-to-cost-in-court">A. General Approach to Cost in Court</span></h3><p>In court proceedings, it is quite common for the court to apply deductions to the costs awarded. A party may be happy if they receive about 70% of their total claimed costs. This is partly due to the relatively low hourly rates used by courts in Hong Kong, which are significantly lower than what law firms may charge for their lawyers’ time. For example, while a law firm partner may charge around $1,500 per hour, the court’s hourly rate is typically in the range of $6,000, which is much lower.</p>
<p>Because of these lower rates, the court effectively applies a “discount” to the costs. Additionally, the court may review the reasonableness of the claimed hours and potentially deduct some of them. For example, if a party claims five hours for a particular task, the court may consider this excessive and reduce the hours claimed. Ultimately, parties should expect that there will always be some deductions to their claimed costs, even in situations where costs are awarded.</p>
<h3><span id="b-security-for-costs-in-arbitration">B. Security for Costs in Arbitration</span></h3><p>In arbitration, the concept of security for costs is more complex and less automatic than in court. In some jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, a court might be more inclined to grant security for costs if a claimant is from a foreign jurisdiction and has concerns about their ability to pay the costs. However, in arbitration, the granting of security is considered an exceptional order, dependent on the specific facts of the case.</p>
<p>One situation where security for costs might be considered in arbitration is when a claimant requires third-party funding. This is often seen as an indication that the claimant may lack the financial resources to pay the opposing party’s costs if they lose the arbitration. In such cases, a tribunal might be more likely to grant security for costs to protect the other party’s potential cost award.</p>
<p>However, there are also situations where a tribunal may not focus on the claimant’s need for third-party funding alone. For example, if the claimant has obtained insurance that covers up to $1 million in costs, this may reduce concerns about their ability to pay the opposing party’s costs, and the tribunal may be less inclined to award security for costs.</p>
<h3><span id="c-security-for-costs-forms-and-approaches">C. Security for Costs – Forms and Approaches</span></h3><p>Typically, security for costs would involve a payment being deposited into a bank account or a similar secured arrangement. However, this is not the only form of security that may be required in arbitration. Tribunals may consider alternative forms of security depending on the circumstances of the case. These alternatives can vary, and the specific form of security will depend on the specifics of the arbitration and the parties involved.</p>
<h3><span id="d-indemnity-costs-in-arbitration">D. Indemnity Costs in Arbitration</span></h3><h4><span id="1-overview">1. Overview</span></h4><p>In exceptional circumstances, costs may be awarded on an “indemnity” basis, allowing the party claiming costs to recover nearly 100% of their expenses. This is a higher threshold than the typical “party and party” or standard cost award, where reductions are common. Under indemnity costs, the burden shifts to the opposing party to prove that the claimed costs are unreasonable, meaning they must demonstrate that the costs are “beyond reasonable.”</p>
<p>For example, if an expert claims 20 hours for research in their schedule of costs, and the opposing party believes this research was unnecessary, they might typically contest the hours. However, under an indemnity costs award, the opposing party would need to show that the claimed research hours were entirely unreasonable or irrelevant to the case. If the party claiming costs can justify the research—for instance, by demonstrating that it strengthened their claim—they are more likely to recover the full amount of their claimed costs.</p>
<p>Indemnity costs are more generous than the standard “party and party” costs, as they cover all the successful party’s expenses, including legal costs and expert fees. Unlike standard costs, indemnity costs are not limited by factors such as the complexity of the case and do not require proportionality.</p>
<p>This shift in burden means that the losing party must show that the costs claimed are unreasonable, and as a result, the successful party is more likely to recover a higher percentage of their costs compared to a standard cost assessment.</p>
<h4><span id="2-circumstances-leading-to-indemnity-costs">2. Circumstances Leading to Indemnity Costs</span></h4><p>Indemnity costs may arise in certain situations, typically when a party takes an unreasonable step that results in additional costs. One common example is the application for setting aside an arbitral award. If an application to set aside an award is unsuccessful, it is often assumed that the application was unreasonable. In such cases, the court may award indemnity costs against the party who brought the unsuccessful application.</p>
<p>Another example of indemnity costs occurs when a party submits evidence that is later found to be falsified or misleading. If the court determines that the evidence was presented with the intent to deceive or mislead the tribunal, the party presenting the false evidence may be ordered to pay indemnity costs as a penalty for their conduct.</p>
<h4><span id="3-case-study">3. Case Study</span></h4><p><strong>⚖️</strong> <strong>Dana Shipping and Trading SA v Sino Channel Asia Ltd [2016] HKEC 599</strong> </p>
<h5><span id="1-background">(1) Background</span></h5><p>Dana commenced arbitration in London for Sino’s failure to perform contractual obligations. </p>
<p>The tribunal issued an award in Dana’s favour and granted Dana leave to enforce the award in Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>Sino applied to set aside that enforcement order on grounds that Sino had not had proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator nor of the arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>In its application for enforcement of the award in HK, Dana applied for payment of the award amount as security. </p>
<p>At the same time, Sino applied to the English Courts to set aside the award. </p>
<p>Sino then argued before the court in HK that both Dana’s application for security and its own application to set aside the HK court enforcement order should be adjourned, pending the outcome of the set aside proceedings in London.</p>
<p>HK court applied the test adopted by the English Courts in Soleh Boneh International Ltd v Government of the Republic of Uganda [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 208 :</p>
<p>HK court found that Sino’s case for setting aside was not strong as its argument that it did not have notice of the arbitration was not strong and it had delayed the setting aside application for six months.</p>
<p>HK court found Sino’s tactics to use agents to enter into contracts and delayed engagement in legal actions as potentially concerning as to ability to pay award.</p>
<p>HK Court ordered security for award to be paid and also ordered indemnity costs – normal cost order in unsuccessful setting aside applications.</p>
<h5><span id="2-aftermath">(2) Aftermath</span></h5><p>Sino failed to make payment into court of the security ordered within the period of 21 days.. As a result, Sino’s application to set aside the Enforcement Order was dismissed. </p>
<p>On 13 May 2016, the English court set aside the award on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction and is of no effect (as Sino had not properly been served).</p>
<p>In purported reliance on the English Judgment, Sino applied again to set aside the Enforcement Order and to take steps to stop enforcement taken by Dana, including garnishee proceedings and a statutory demand.</p>
<p>English Court of Appeal later upheld award on the basis that in unusual circumstances of case service of Notice of Arbitration had been sucessful.</p>
<h4><span id="4-key-takeaways">4. Key Takeaways</span></h4><ul>
<li><strong>Cost Deduction:</strong> In both court and arbitration, parties should expect some degree of cost deduction. The court’s lower hourly rate and scrutiny of reasonableness contribute to this.</li>
<li><strong>Security for Costs:</strong> In arbitration, security for costs is an exceptional measure, often linked to concerns over a claimant’s ability to pay costs. Third-party funding or insurance may affect the decision on security.</li>
<li><strong>Indemnity Costs:</strong> Indemnity costs can be awarded in exceptional circumstances, such as the failure of a setting-aside application or the submission of falsified evidence. This type of award allows the prevailing party to recover nearly all their costs, with the opposing party bearing a higher burden to prove unreasonableness.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Considerations:</strong> Parties involved in arbitration must carefully consider their actions, such as the timing of applications and the reasonableness of their cost claims, as these factors can significantly influence the final cost award.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vii-outcome-related-fee-structures">VII. Outcome related fee structures</span></h2><p>In certain cases, fee structures are tied to the outcome of the arbitration, such as contingency fee arrangements. Under such agreements, legal costs may not be incurred upfront but are contingent on the outcome. Despite this, the party may still seek to recover legal fees if they succeed in the arbitration. This situation introduces complexities regarding cost recovery, particularly in cases where no legal costs have been incurred until the contingency is met.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency Fee Structures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legal fees may be contingent on the outcome, with no upfront costs</li>
<li>Even if no costs are incurred initially, a party may seek recovery of fees after a successful outcome</li>
<li>The tribunal may allow recovery of fees based on the agreement and the result of the arbitration</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arbitration (Outcome Related Fee Structures for Arbitration) Rules (Cap. 609D) came into effect on 16 December 2022 </p>
<p>The new rules were introduced following the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong’s report published in December 2021. Recommended that the law in Hong Kong be amended to lift the prohibitions on the use of ORFS by lawyers in arbitration taking place in and outside Hong Kong</p>
<p>ORFS for arbitration are an exception to the common law rules of champerty and maintenance, which prohibit third parties from providing financial assistance to a litigant in return for a share of the proceeds</p>
<p>Refers to the three types of agreements which a lawyer may enter into with a client:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional fee agreements </li>
<li>Damages-based agreements </li>
<li>Hybrid damages-based agreements</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="viii-strategic-and-procedural-considerations-in-arbitration">VIII. Strategic and Procedural Considerations in Arbitration</span></h2><p>In arbitration, the timing and conduct of the parties play a critical role in shaping the outcome of the proceedings. A delay in raising certain issues can have significant consequences, as seen in the example discussed.</p>
<h3><span id="a-initial-procedural-flaws">A. Initial Procedural Flaws</span></h3><p>The core issue in this case stems from the failure to raise an important objection immediately after the notice of arbitration was filed. Had the objection been brought at that time, it is likely that the tribunal would have made an early determination, potentially rejecting the claim outright. This failure to act promptly meant that the party involved wasted approximately two and a half years of the arbitration process, incurring both costs and time without achieving any substantial progress.</p>
<p>It is important to note that certain procedural requirements, such as the need for clear and unequivocal wording in the accompanying documentation, were not met. The party’s submission was conditional, which created ambiguity in the tribunal’s assessment. This lack of clarity could have been addressed much earlier in the proceedings, potentially preventing the need for further steps.</p>
<h3><span id="b-cost-implications-and-tribunals-approach">B. Cost Implications and Tribunal’s Approach</span></h3><p>Despite the delays, the tribunal ultimately decided that neither party should bear the full cost of the other party. The losing party, who would typically be required to pay the costs, was relieved of this responsibility. The tribunal did not find evidence of bad faith or any ulterior motive to intentionally delay or inflate costs. As a result, both parties were directed to bear their own costs.</p>
<p>The tribunal’s decision highlights the importance of presenting a compelling and transparent case, as the absence of malicious intent and lack of evidence of improper conduct were key factors in the ruling. Nevertheless, the delay in raising the objection led to unnecessary costs and procedural complications, which could have been avoided with earlier action.</p>
<h3><span id="c-jurisdictional-objections-and-strategic-considerations">C. Jurisdictional Objections and Strategic Considerations</span></h3><p>This situation serves as a reminder of the strategic considerations involved in raising jurisdictional objections in arbitration. As discussed in previous sessions, parties may decide to waive objections at the outset for strategic reasons. However, if these objections are raised later in the proceedings, especially after significant steps have already been taken, the party may be held liable for the additional costs incurred as a result of the delay. Raising objections too late could be seen as an attempt to delay proceedings or increase costs unnecessarily, potentially influencing the tribunal’s cost allocation decisions.</p>
<h3><span id="d-the-importance-of-full-disclosure-in-enforcement-applications">D. The Importance of Full Disclosure in Enforcement Applications</span></h3><p>A similar issue arises in the enforcement of arbitral awards. For instance, if a party fails to disclose that there is an ongoing challenge to the award at the seat of arbitration, this omission may not directly affect the enforcement process, but it remains a material fact that must be disclosed. In such cases, courts expect parties to be fully transparent, even if the omitted information is detrimental to their position.</p>
<p>In an enforcement application, failure to disclose significant facts—such as an ongoing challenge to the award—can lead to serious consequences. Even if the challenge ultimately does not succeed, the court may consider the omission to be material and may refuse to grant the enforcement order. In this particular case, the failure to disclose the challenge resulted in the respondent being required to pay the applicant’s costs for the enforcement application.</p>
<h3><span id="e-key-takeaways">E. Key Takeaways</span></h3><ol>
<li><strong>Timeliness Matters:</strong> Raising objections and addressing procedural issues at the earliest opportunity can prevent unnecessary delays and costs.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Allocation:</strong> Parties who cause delays by raising objections late may be held liable for the additional costs incurred.</li>
<li><strong>Full Disclosure in Enforcement Applications:</strong> Parties must disclose all material facts, including those that may not be favorable to their case, to avoid negative consequences in the enforcement process.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Decisions:</strong> Strategic choices regarding when to raise objections or disclose information can significantly impact the outcome of the arbitration, both in terms of procedural efficiency and cost allocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This case underscores the importance of adhering to procedural timelines, maintaining transparency, and being mindful of the costs associated with delays and strategic decisions.</p>
<h3><span id="ix-cost-recovery">IX. Cost Recovery</span></h3><p>The issue of cost recovery is often contentious in arbitration, particularly when the success of a claim is marginal. Courts and tribunals assess whether the costs incurred by a party are reasonable, and failing to provide sufficient evidence can lead to reduced recoverable costs or even the requirement to pay the other party’s costs.</p>
<h3><span id="a-case-example-minimal-success-and-cost-allocation">A. Case Example: Minimal Success and Cost Allocation</span></h3><p>In a particular case, the claimant succeeded in only 0.5% of the total amount in dispute, a very minimal success. While technically the claimant was considered the successful party, the tribunal found that this did not justify awarding the claimant full costs. Instead, the tribunal ordered the claimant to pay the respondent’s costs, with only minor reductions made for certain travel costs that were deemed unreasonable.</p>
<p>This decision underscores that success in an arbitration is not always directly correlated to the allocation of costs. Even a technically successful party may find itself bearing significant costs if the tribunal perceives that the success achieved was limited in scope and impact.</p>
<h3><span id="b-importance-of-detailed-cost-evidence">B. Importance of Detailed Cost Evidence</span></h3><p>When submitting cost claims, it is essential to provide detailed and specific evidence of the costs incurred. While you are not required to group costs into categories, you must set out sufficient particulars for the tribunal or court to understand the justification for each cost. This may include explaining why certain expenses were necessary and directly related to the arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>The tribunal’s decision in this case involved some minor reductions to the claimant’s costs, despite a lack of detailed evidence for every expense. This highlights the tribunal’s recognition that some costs may not have been fully justified, even if they were not explained in detail.</p>
<h3><span id="c-contesting-costs-the-risks-of-insufficient-detail">C. Contesting Costs: The Risks of Insufficient Detail</span></h3><p>In most arbitration cases, costs are contested. It is rare that a tribunal or court will simply accept a schedule of costs without scrutiny. The opposing party will often challenge the reasonableness of the costs incurred, questioning whether certain expenses were necessary or whether the time spent on particular tasks was justified.</p>
<p>For example, the opposing party might argue that research hours should not be recoverable because the research was not sufficiently relevant to the issues at hand. Such challenges can result in a “mini-trial” on the costs, where both parties must justify the reasonableness of their claimed costs. This process can be time-consuming and complex, requiring careful preparation of cost schedules and explanations.</p>
<h3><span id="d-the-risk-of-inadequate-cost-documentation">D. The Risk of Inadequate Cost Documentation</span></h3><p>If a party fails to provide sufficient particulars for the costs claimed, the tribunal may not be able to assess the reasonableness of each item. In this case, the tribunal may decide not to go through each cost item in detail and could instead make a general reduction, such as awarding only 60% of the claimed costs. This could leave the party with a significantly reduced amount of recoverable costs, even if their overall claim was valid.</p>
<h3><span id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</span></h3><ol>
<li><strong>Cost Allocation Is Not Automatic:</strong> Even if a party is successful, they may not automatically recover all of their costs, particularly if the success is marginal.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Cost Evidence Is Crucial:</strong> Parties must provide detailed and clear evidence to justify each cost incurred, including explaining the relevance and necessity of each expense.</li>
<li><strong>Contested Costs Are Common:</strong> It is rare for costs to be accepted without challenge. The opposing party may scrutinize the costs in detail, and tribunals will expect justification for each item.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Insufficient Detail:</strong> Failure to provide sufficient particulars or evidence for claimed costs can result in significant reductions, as tribunals may not have the time or information to assess costs on a line-by-line basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>This case highlights the importance of meticulous preparation when it comes to cost submissions in arbitration. Providing clear, detailed evidence not only supports the reasonableness of the costs but also reduces the risk of arbitrary reductions by the tribunal.</p>

<h1><span id="class-10-interest">Class 10 - Interest</span></h1><h2><span id="i-overview">I. Overview</span></h2><h3><span id="a-what-is-interest">A. What is interest?</span></h3><p><strong>Interest</strong> is the money paid as compensation for borrowing money or delaying payment. It’s like a “fee” for using someone else’s money.</p>
<p>Interest is calculated as a <strong>percentage</strong> of the amount borrowed (called the <strong>principal</strong>). It reflects the <strong>time-value of money</strong>, meaning money is worth more now than in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Types of interest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-award interest:</strong> This is the interest you can get before an award is made in arbitration.</li>
<li><strong>Post-award interest:</strong> This is the interest that starts after the arbitration award is made.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simple vs. Compound interest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple interest</strong> is calculated only on the original amount borrowed (the principal).</li>
<li><strong>Compound interest</strong> is calculated on the original amount plus any accumulated interest.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-arbitration-ordinance-cap-609">B. Arbitration Ordinance Cap 609</span></h3><p>This is the law that guides how interest works in arbitration in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>Section 79: Arbitral tribunal may award interest</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The tribunal can award either <strong>simple</strong> or <strong>compound</strong> interest, based on what they think is fair.</li>
<li>This interest can be awarded on:<ul>
<li>Money that’s awarded by the tribunal.</li>
<li>Money claimed before the arbitration starts but paid before the award is made.</li>
<li>Costs awarded during arbitration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 79 - Arbitral tribunal may award interest</strong><br>(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitral tribunal may, in the arbitral proceedings before it, award simple or compound interest from the dates, at the rates, and with the rests that the tribunal considers appropriate, subject to section 80, for any period ending not later than the date of payment—<br>(a) on money awarded by the tribunal in the arbitral proceedings;<br>(b) on money claimed in, and outstanding at the commencement of, the arbitral proceedings but paid before the award is made; or<br>(c) on costs awarded or ordered by the tribunal in the arbitral proceedings.<br>(2) Subsection (1) does not affect any other power of an arbitral tribunal to award interest.<br>(3) A reference in subsection (1)(a) to money awarded by the tribunal includes an amount payable in consequence of a declaratory award by the tribunal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Section 80: Interest on money or costs awarded or ordered</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the award is made, interest on the money owed is typically calculated at the <strong>judgment rate</strong>, unless the award says otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Costs</strong> (like legal fees) can also attract interest.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Section 80- Interest on money or costs awarded or ordered in arbitral proceedings</strong><br>(1) Interest is payable on money awarded by an arbitral tribunal from the date of the award at the judgment rate, except when the award otherwise provides.<br>(2) Interest is payable on costs awarded or ordered by an arbitral tribunal from—<br>(a) the date of the award or order on costs; or<br>(b) the date on which costs ordered are directed to be paid forthwith, at the judgment rate, except when the award or order on costs otherwise provides.<br>(3) In this section, “judgment rate” (判定利率) means the rate of interest determined by the Chief Justice under section 49(1)(b) (Interest on judgments) of the High Court Ordinance (Cap 4). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under Section 80, except where the award provides otherwise, interest is payable at the judgment rate.</p>
<h3><span id="c-judgment-rate">C. Judgment Rate</span></h3><p>The <strong>judgment rate</strong> is the interest rate that applies to money owed after a judgment or award.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Under Section 49 of the High Court Ordinance (Cap 4)</strong>, this rate is decided by the <strong>Chief Justice</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>High Court Ordinance Cap 4</strong><br> <strong>Section 49 – Interest on judgments</strong><br>Judgment debts shall carry simple interest-<br>(a) at such rate as the Court of First Instance may order; or<br>(b) in the absence of such order, at such rate as may be determined from time to time by the Chief Justice by order, on the aggregate amount thereof, or on such part thereof as for the time being remains unsatisfied from the date of the judgment until satisfaction.<br>(2) Interest under this section may be calculated at different rates in respect of different periods.</p>

<li>The Privy Council ruled that the <strong>arbitrator’s award of compound interest</strong> was incorrect because the arbitrator didn’t have the authority to do so under <strong>the law of the seat (Jamaica)</strong>.</li>
<li>The case was sent back to the arbitrator for reconsideration.</li>
<li><strong>The Dispute:</strong> There was a joint venture project in Jamaica between the <strong>National Housing Trust (Trust)</strong> and <strong>YP Seaton &amp; Associates Co Ltd (YPSA)</strong>. It involved constructing housing units and related facilities.</li>
<li><strong>The Issue:</strong> The dispute was over project accounts, and some of the matters were settled through a <strong>compromise agreement</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> In 2004, the Trust and YPSA referred two unresolved issues to arbitration:<ol>
<li>The interest owed to the Trust.</li>
<li>The contractor’s profit owed to YPSA (14.8% of the value of the works).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>First Award:</strong><ul>
<li>The arbitrator didn’t award interest because <strong>YPSA hadn’t formally claimed it</strong>.</li>
<li>The arbitrator ordered the Trust to pay YPSA the agreed profit (J$24,325,000).</li>
<li>YPSA then <strong>applied to the Jamaican court</strong> to have the arbitrator reconsider the interest issue, claiming that it had already asked for 12% interest (compounded monthly) in its original claim.</li>
<li>The court agreed, and the issue was sent back to the arbitrator to reconsider the interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Supplementary Award:</strong><ul>
<li>The arbitrator, after receiving further submissions, awarded <strong>compound interest</strong> of <strong>J$214,512,232.76</strong> for the period from 1997 to 2007.</li>
<li>The Trust asked the Jamaican Supreme Court to <strong>set aside</strong> this award, arguing the arbitrator had no power to award <strong>compound interest</strong> under Jamaican law.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court agreed with the Trust and set aside the award, saying the arbitrator couldn’t award compound interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>YPSA’s Appeal to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica:</strong><ul>
<li>YPSA appealed, and the <strong>Court of Appeal</strong> ruled in its favor, arguing the arbitrator had the discretion to award compound interest based on <strong>general law</strong>.</li>
<li>The Court of Appeal said the arbitrator’s decision was based on <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>equity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trust’s Appeal to the Privy Council:</strong><ul>
<li>The Trust then took the case to the <strong>Privy Council</strong>, which <strong>allowed the appeal</strong> and set aside the compound interest award, sending it back to the arbitrator.</li>
<li>The Privy Council disagreed with the Court of Appeal, saying that the arbitrator couldn’t just award compound interest based on general fairness. The arbitrator had to follow <strong>Jamaican law</strong>.</li>
<li>The law in Jamaica (The <strong>Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1955</strong>) only allows <strong>simple interest</strong> to be awarded.</li>
<li>The Privy Council ruled that the arbitrator had <strong>exceeded his jurisdiction</strong> by awarding compound interest.</li>
<li><strong>Lord Toulson’s Dissent:</strong> Lord Toulson disagreed with the majority of the Privy Council. He argued that the arbitrator should have the discretion to award compound interest, as it was necessary to put YPSA in the same position as it would have been if the dispute hadn’t happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="b-background">B. Background</span></h3><p>The dispute arose out of a joint venture between the National Housing Trust (“Trust”) –– and YP Seaton &amp; Associates Co Ltd (“YPSA”)</p>
<p>Re-construction and development of housing units and related facilities in Jamaica.</p>
<p>The dispute concerned the joint venture’s project accounts, and was settled in part by a compromise agreement (the “Compromise Agreement”). </p>
<p>In April 2004, the parties referred two outstanding items to arbitration before a sole arbitrator to determine: </p>
<p>(i) the interest portion owed to Trust in respect of an 18 January 1999 statement (which had a value of J$27,255,919.92), and </p>
<p>(ii) the contractor’s profit owed to YPSA, which the parties agreed should be 14.8% of the value of the works. </p>
<h3><span id="c-the-arbitration">C. The Arbitration</span></h3><h4><span id="1-the-first-award">1. The First Award</span></h4><p>Arbitrator awarded no interest because he said none had been claimed or pleaded by YPSA.  </p>
<p>Arbitrator ordered that Trust pay YPSA J$24,325,000 as contractor’s profit, 14.8% of the total value of the works (the “First Award”). </p>
<p>Within six months of the First Award, the Trust made the payment of J$24,325,000 to YPSA, as agreed in the Compromise Agreement.</p>
<p>YPSA later applied to the Supreme Court of Jamaica to have the matter remitted to the arbitrator so that he could re-consider the question of interest.  </p>
<p>YPSA’s position was that the arbitrator had been wrong to say that YPSA had not claimed interest because YPSA’s points of claim claimed interest at 12% annually compounded monthly from completion until payment. </p>
<p>On 22 January 2007, the Court remitted the matter to the arbitrator for him “to consider and arbitrate on the issue of interest on the profit awarded.”</p>
<h4><span id="2-the-supplementary-award">2. The Supplementary Award</span></h4><p>The parties made further written and oral submissions to the arbitrator on the issue of interest, if any, owed to YPSA on the profit awarded. </p>
<p>By a supplementary award, the arbitrator awarded J$214,512,232.76 to YPSA as compound interest for the period 30 October 1997 to January 2007 on the profits awarded (the “Supplementary Award”).</p>
<p>In response, the Trust applied to the Supreme Court of Jamaica to have the Supplementary Award set aside and the matter remitted to the arbitrator “to reconsider and arbitrate on the issue of interest in accordance with the laws of Jamaica”.</p>
<p>The Court granted Trust’s applications. It found that the arbitrator had no power to award compound interest in this case.  </p>
<p>Award was therefore set aside.</p>
<h4><span id="3-ypsas-appeal-to-the-court-of-appeal-of-jamaica">3. YPSA’s appeal to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica</span></h4><p>YPSA then appealed to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica (the “Court of Appeal”), which allowed the appeal. </p>
<p>The Court of Appeal accepted YPSA’s alternative argument that the arbitrator awarded compound interest not on the basis of any right by contract but rather by relying on a general common law power to award damages.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal concluded that the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to make an award of compound interest was  </p>
<p>“in accordance with the general law applicable to the dispute submitted to him. He was required to utilise his experience and expertise and to exercise his discretion to do what was just and equitable in resolving the dispute between the parties.” </p>
<h4><span id="4-trusts-appeal-to-the-privy-council">4. Trust’s appeal to the Privy Council</span></h4><p>Trust appealed to the Privy Council, which allowed the appeal and set aside the Supplementary Award, remitting it to the arbitrator as originally ordered by the lower court.</p>
<p>The Privy Council found that the Court of Appeal was mistaken in treating the arbitrator’s award of compound interest as based on a substantive legal right, such as a contractual right under the loan agreement or a claim in damages for breach of contract or equity. The Privy Council also disagreed with the Court of Appeal’s view that the arbitrator had the discretion to make such an award under those circumstances.</p>
<p>The Privy Council ruled that arbitrators do not have a general discretion to award compound interest. Instead, they should follow the law of the seat concerning the power to award interest. In this case, Section 3 of The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1955 of Jamaica limits interest awards to simple interest. By awarding compound interest, the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction and the powers impliedly granted by the parties through the Compromise Agreement and the terms of reference.</p>
<p>Lord Toulson gave a dissenting opinion, agreeing with the Court of Appeal on the compound interest issue. He highlighted that the arbitrator had awarded compound interest because he believed it was necessary to restore YPSA to the same position it would have been in had the breach not occurred. Lord Toulson therefore found no sufficient reason for the court to disturb the award.</p>
<h3><span id="d-takeaway-from-this-case">D. Takeaway from this case</span></h3><p>This case confirms the position that whether a tribunal can award compound interest is first and foremost a matter of the parties’ agreement, and in the absence of such agreement, is then a function of the law of the seat of the arbitration. </p>
<p>For UK, see Section 49 of the English Arbitration Act 1996: in the absence of any agreement by the parties to the contrary, an arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to award simple or compound interest as it considers is appropriate. </p>
<h2><span id="iii-interest-vs-penalty-clause">III. Interest vs. Penalty Clause</span></h2><h3><span id="a-law-ting-pong-secondary-school-v-cheng-wai-wah-2021-hkca-873">A. Law Ting Pong Secondary School v Cheng Wai Wah [2021] HKCA 873</span></h3><p>This case discusses how to <strong>distinguish between an interest clause and a penalty clause</strong>.</p>
<h4><span id="key-point"><strong>Key Point:</strong></span></h4><ul>
<li>The <strong>court’s test</strong> for whether a clause is a penalty or not involves looking at the <strong>legitimate interest</strong> of the party that benefits from the clause.</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> The court will first ask what the party was trying to protect with the clause. For example, were they trying to ensure they were compensated for losses caused by a breach, or was the clause mainly designed to <strong>deter</strong> the other party from breaching?</li>
<li>The court will also consider the <strong>circumstances when the contract was made</strong> to understand if the clause is fair and proportional to the loss expected.</li>
<li><strong>Penalty Clause:</strong> A clause becomes a penalty if it imposes a sum that is <strong>out of proportion</strong> to the legitimate interest of the innocent party. In other words, it’s a penalty if it’s designed to punish or deter, rather than compensate for loss.</li>
<li><strong>Not a Penalty Clause:</strong> If the clause is about a <strong>primary obligation</strong> (like agreeing to pay a fixed amount of money), it’s not a penalty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In applying the test, the court should first identify the legitimate interest of the innocent party that is being protected by the clause, and then assess whether the clause is out of all proportion to the legitimate interest by considering the circumstances in which the contract was made. Notions of whether the clause has a deterrent purpose or whether it is a genuine pre-estimate of loss would be subsumed by the broader enquiry into the legitimacy of the interest that supports the provision.</p>
<p>It is not applicable to contractual provisions which stipulate to pay a certain amount of money by way of a primary obligation. This means a clause can only be a penalty if, as a matter of substance, it operates upon a breach of contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="b-interest-x2f-penalty-clause">B. Interest &#x2F; penalty clause</span></h3><p>Chengdu Zhongtai Transportation Construction Development Co Ltd v Neo China Land Group (Holdings) Ltd [2013] HKCFI 551 </p>
<p>This case involves a <strong>contract clause</strong> that provided a <strong>15% interest rate</strong> for late payments and a <strong>20% fixed sum</strong> if the payment wasn’t made within <strong>120 days</strong> after the due date.</p>
<h4><span id="key-points"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></h4><ul>
<li>The court found that the provisions were <strong>penalties</strong> because they were not genuine pre-estimates of loss. They were not designed to compensate for actual loss, but rather to <strong>deter</strong> Neo-China Group from breaching the contract.</li>
<li>The clauses were seen as <strong>fixed amounts</strong> designed to make the contract more <strong>intimidating</strong> (in terrorem) rather than compensating Zhongtai for any real loss caused by the late payment.</li>
<li>As a result, <strong>penalty clauses</strong> like these are <strong>not enforceable</strong>. Instead, Zhongtai could only claim for the actual loss (like the shortfall in the share transfer price) and normal commercial interest.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The STA provided for a 15% interest rate in the case of late payment and a fixed sum equivalent to 20% of the outstanding balance if the payment was not made within 120 days after the due date. In the absence of any evidence showing that the liquidated damages and interest provided for in the STA are genuine pre-estimates of Zhongtai’s loss, I am of the view that those are penalties as they are sums fixed in terrorem. The predominant contractual function of the provision was to deter Neo-China Group from breaking the STA and not to compensate Zhongtai for the breach. Hence, if Neo-China is liable, Zhongtai should only be able to claim the sum of RMBY40,000,000, being the shortfall in the shares transfer price, against Neo-China together with normal commercial interest. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="c-takeaway">C. Takeaway</span></h3><ul>
<li><strong>Interest Clause:</strong> If it reflects a genuine attempt to compensate the innocent party for the delay (a pre-estimate of loss), it’s typically enforceable.</li>
<li><strong>Penalty Clause:</strong> If the clause is intended to punish or deter the other party (and doesn’t genuinely relate to the actual loss suffered), it may be deemed an unenforceable penalty. The focus is on the <strong>legitimate interest</strong> of the party enforcing the clause and ensuring it isn’t disproportionate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, <strong>interest clauses</strong> are often valid as long as they relate to real loss, while <strong>penalty clauses</strong> are unenforceable if they are simply meant to deter breaches or impose disproportionate sums.</p>
