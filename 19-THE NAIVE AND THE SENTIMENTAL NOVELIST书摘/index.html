          <h2><span id="what-our-minds-do-when-we-read-novels">What Our Minds Do When We Read Novels</span></h2><ul>
<li>Novels are second lives.</li>
<li>Novels reveal the colors and complexities of our lives and are full of people, faces, and objects we feel we recognize.</li>
<li><u>But we never complain of this illusion, this naïveté.</u> On the contrary, just as in some dreams, we want the novel we are reading to continue and hope that this second life will keep evoking in us a consistent sense of reality and authenticity.</li>
<li>We dream assuming dreams to be real; such is the definition of dreams.</li>
<li>I know there are many stances we can adopt toward the novel, <u>many ways in which we commit our soul and mind to it, treating it lightly or seriously</u>.</li>
<li>We read sometimes logically, sometimes with our eyes, sometimes with our imagination, sometimes with a small part of our mind, sometimes the way we want to, sometimes the way the book wants us to, and sometimes with every fiber of our being. </li>
<li><u>There was a time in my youth when I completely dedicated myself to novels, reading them intently—even ecstatically.</u> During those years, from the age of eighteen to the age of thirty (1970 to 1982), I wanted to describe what went on in my head and in my soul the way a painter depicts with precision and clarity a vivid, complicated, animated landscape filled with mountains, plains, rocks, woods, and rivers.</li>
<li>When I read novels in my youth, sometimes a broad, deep, peaceful landscape would appear within me. And sometimes the lights would go out, black and white would sharpen and then separate, and the shadows would stir. Sometimes I would marvel at the feeling that the whole world was made of a quite different light. And sometimes twilight would pervade and cover everything, the whole universe would become a single emotion and a single style, and I would understand that I enjoyed this and would sense that I was reading the book for this particular atmosphere. </li>
<li>I would feel that the orange armchair I was sitting in, the stinking ashtray beside me, the carpeted room, the children playing soccer in the street yelling at each other, and the ferry whistles from afar were receding from my mind; and that a new world was revealing itself, word by word, sentence by sentence, in front of me. <u>As I read page after page, this new world would crystallize and become clearer</u>, just like those secret drawings which slowly appear when a reagent is poured on them; and lines, shadows, events, and protagonists would come into focus. <u>During these opening moments, everything that delayed my entry into the world of the novel and that impeded my remembering and envisioning the characters, events, and objects would distress and annoy me.</u></li>
<li>And while my eyes eagerly scanned the words, I wished, with a blend of impatience and pleasure, that everything would fall promptly into place.</li>
<li>At such moments, all the doors of my perception would open as wide as possible, like the senses of a timid animal released into a completely alien environment, and my mind would begin to function much faster, almost in a state of panic.</li>
<li>A little later, the intense and tiring effort would yield results and the broad landscape I wanted to see would open up before me, like a huge continent appearing in all its vividness after the fog lifts.</li>
<li>Here, the writer’s attention to visual detail, and the reader’s ability to transform words into a large landscape painting through visualization, are decisive.</li>
<li>And we read such stories just as if we were observing a landscape and, by transforming it in our mind’s eye into a painting, accustoming ourselves to the atmosphere of the scene, <u>letting ourselves be influenced by it</u>, and in fact constantly searching for it.</li>
<li>If she were able to focus on her novel, she could easily imagine Lady Mary mounting her horse and following the pack of hounds. She would visualize the scene as if she were gazing out a window and would feel herself slowly entering this scene she observes from the outside.</li>
<li>Most novelists sense that reading the opening pages of a novel is akin to entering a landscape painting.</li>
<li>The real pleasure of reading a novel starts with the ability to see the world not from the outside but through the eyes of the protagonists living in that world.</li>
<li>When we read a novel, we oscillate between the long view and fleeting moments, general thoughts and specific events, at a speed which no other literary genre can offer.</li>
<li>We are now inside the landscape that a short while ago we were gazing at from the outside: in addition to seeing the mountains in our mind’s eye, we feel the coolness of the river and catch the scent of the forest, speak to the protagonists and make our way deeper into the universe of the novel.</li>
<li>Our mind and our perception work intently, with great rapidity and concentration, carrying out numerous operations simultaneously, but many of us no longer even realize that we are carrying out these operations.</li>
<li>Let us use the word “naive” to describe this type of sensibility, this type of novelist and novel reader—those who are not at all concerned with the artificial aspects of writing and reading a novel. And let us use the term “reflective” to describe precisely the opposite sensibility: in other words, the readers and writers who are fascinated by the artificiality of the text and its failure to attain reality, and who pay close attention to the methods used in writing novels and to the way our mind works as we read. <u>Being a novelist is the art of being both naive and reflective at the same time.</u></li>
<li>The word <em>sentimentalisch</em> in German, used by Schiller to describe the thoughtful, troubled modern poet who has lost his childlike character and naïveté, is somewhat different in meaning from the word “sentimental,” its counterpart in English.</li>
<li>Naive poets are one with nature; in fact, they are like nature—calm, cruel, and wise. They write poetry spontaneously, almost without thinking, not bothering to consider the intellectual or ethical consequences of their words and paying no attention to what others might say. For them—in contrast to contemporary writers—poetry is like an impression that nature makes upon them quite organically and that never leaves them. Poetry comes spontaneously to naive poets from the natural universe they are part of.</li>
<li>The naive poet has no doubt that his utterances, words, verse will portray the general landscape, that they will represent it, that they will adequately <u>and thoroughly describe and reveal the meaning of the world—since this meaning is neither distant nor concealed from him.</u></li>
<li>The “sentimental” (emotional, reflective) poet is uneasy, above all, in one respect: he is unsure whether his words will encompass reality, whether they will attain it, whether his utteranees will convey the meaning he intends. So he is exceedingly aware of the poem he writes, the methods and techniques he uses, and the artifice involved in his endeavor.</li>
<li>From the age of seven until I was twenty-two, I constantly painted with the dream of someday becoming a painter, but I had remained a naive artist and had abandoned painting, perhaps after becoming aware of this.</li>
<li>This dense and provocative work by Schiller will accompany me while I contemplate the art of the novel, reminding me along the way of my own youth, which discreetly oscillated between the “naive” and the “sentimental.”</li>
<li>When Schiller says, “There are two different types of humanity,” he also wants to say, according to German literary historians, “Those that are naive like Goethe and those that are sentimental like me!”</li>
<li><u>Schiller envied Goethe not only for his poetic gifts, but also for his serenity, unaffectedness, egoism, self-confidence, and aristocratic spirit; for the way he effortlessly came up with great and brilliant thoughts; for his ability to be himself; for his simplicity, modesty, and genius; and for his unawareness of all this, precisely in the manner of a child.</u> In contrast, Schiller himself was far more reflective and intellectual, more complex and tormented in his literary activity, far more aware of his literary methods, full of questions and uncertainties regarding them—and felt that these attitudes and traits were more “modern.”</li>
<li>I try to convince myself that I have found an equilibrium between the naive novelist and the sentimental novelist inside me.</li>
<li>The naive novelist and the naive reader are like people who sincerely believe that they understand the country and the people they see from the window as the car moves through the landscape.</li>
<li>In contrast, <u>the sentimental-reflective novelist will say that the view from the car window is limited by the frame and that the windshield is muddy anyway</u>, and he will withdraw into a Beckettian silence.</li>
<li>We read adventure novels, chivalric novels, cheap novels (detective novels, romance novels, spy novels, and so on may be added to this list) to see what happens next; but we read the modern novel (he meant what we today call the “literary novel”) for its atmosphere.</li>
<li>Another part of our mind wonders how much of the story the writer tells is real experience and how much is imagination. We ask this question especially in the parts of the novel that arouse our wonder, admiration, and amazement.</li>
<li>At the heart of the novelist’s craft lies an optimism which thinks that the knowledge we gather from our everyday experience, if given proper form, can become valuable knowledge about reality.</li>
<li>We make moral judgments about both the choices and the behavior of the protagonists; at the same time, we judge the writer for his moral judgments regarding his characters. </li>
<li>Let us always keep in mind that the art of the novel yields its finest results not through judging people but through understanding them, and let us avoid being ruled by the judgmental part of our mind. When we read a novel, morality should be a part of the landscape, not something that emanates from within us and targets the characters.</li>
<li>As our mind performs all of these operations simultaneously, we congratulate ourselves on the knowledge, depth, and understanding we have attained. Especially in novels of high literary quality, the intense relationship we establish with the text seems to us readers to be our own private success. </li>
<li>In order to find meaning and readerly pleasure in the universe the writer reveals to us, we feel we must search for the novel’s secret center, and we therefore try to embed every detail of the novel in our memory, as if learning each leaf of a tree by heart.</li>
<li>What sets novels apart from other literary narratives is that they have a secret center. Or, more precisely, they rely on our conviction that there is a center we should search for as we read.</li>
<li>Novels are narratives open to feelings of guilt, paranoia, and anxiety. The sense of depth which we feel when we read a novel, the illusion that the book immerses us in a three-dimensional universe, stems from the presence of the center, whether real or imaginary.</li>
<li>Novels present characters that are much more complex than those in epics; they focus on everyday people and delve into all the aspects of everyday life. But they owe these qualities and powers to the presence of a center somewhere in the background, and to the fact that we read them with this kind of hope.</li>
<li>As the novel reveals to us life’s mundane details and our small fantasies, daily habits, and familiar objects, we read on curiously—in fact, in amazement—because we know they indicate a deeper meaning, a purpose somewhere in the background.</li>
<li>Novels can address people of the modern era, indeed all humanity, because they are three-dimensional fictions. They can speak of personal experience, the knowledge we acquire through our senses, and at the same time they can provide a fragment of knowledge, an intuition, a clue about the deepest thing—in other words, the center, or what Tolstoy would call the meaning of life (or however we refer to it), that difficult-to-reach place we optimistically think exists.</li>
<li>The dream of attaining the deepest, dearest knowledge of the world and of life without having to endure the difficulties of philosophy or the social pressures of religion—and doing this on the basis of our own experience, using our own intellect—is a very egalitarian, very democratic kind of hope.</li>
<li>I read novels as if in a dream state, forgetting everything else, in order to gain knowledge of the world, to construct myself, and to shape my soul.</li>
<li>Gradually I began to see the fundamental knowledge that the center of the novel presented—knowledge about what kind of place the world was, and about the nature of life, not only in the center but everywhere in the novel.</li>
<li>I also learned that our journey in this world, the life we spend in cities, streets, houses, rooms, and nature, consists of nothing but a search for a secret meaning which may or may not exist.</li>
<li>Just like readers searching for the center as they read a novel, or naive young protagonists in a <em>Bildungsroman</em> searching for the meaning of life with curiosity, sincerity, and faith, we will try to progress toward the center of the art of the novel. <u>The broad landscape we move through will take us to the writer, to the idea of fiction and fictionality, to characters in novels, to the narrative plot, to the problem of time, to objects, to seeing, to museums, and to places we cannot yet anticipate—perhaps just like a real novel.</u></li>

<li>Nurturing a love of novels, developing the habit of reading novels, indicates <u>a desire to escape the logic of the single-centered Cartesian world where body and mind, logic and imagination, are placed in opposition.</u></li>
